# Game Boy Essentials Is Portable!

Have you been reading Game Boy Essentials but wished it was portable? Are you tired of having to carry a large computer to read the website? Do you wish there was an easy way to access the website while on the go? Now you can with the book version of Game Boy Essentials! The books are small 5.5 by 8.5 inches paperbacks. Each book includes 12 articles from the project, accompanied by an introduction. If you want to support the labour of love that is Game Boy Essentials, consider buying one of my books.

The books are self-published through Amazon, and are sold for a very affordable $10 USD in all the Amazon stores around the world. **Volume 2 is currently unavailable, as I am preparing an updated edition. Email me for more details.**
