# Timeline of Significant Game Boy Events

This list is a work in progress. It is not exhaustive at this point, and serves as a writing aid for my articles. Feel free to contact me with any addition at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.

## A Note on Europe

Very little information is written in this note that pertains to Europe; this is unfortunately by design. A lot of fundamental research about the release dates of European Game Boy titles is missing. What is available is often only a year, when I want this list to be month by month.

There is also a lack of specificity of the European market; a title could have been released in one year in the UK and the next year in France, while never having been made available in Germany. Assigning a single year to a situation this complex is, in my opinion, peddling false information.

For example, the original European release date of the Game Boy is unsourced on Wikipedia at the time of writing these lines. This means that we must trust Wikipedia to faithfully report on the release date of the Game Boy in Europe. All of the many different countries of Europe, reduced to one unsourced date. I might as well throw a dart at a calendar.
