# Timeline of Significant Game Boy Events

This list is a work in progress. It is not exhaustive at this point, and serves as a writing aid for my articles. Feel free to contact me with any addition at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.

## A Note on Europe

Very little information is written in this note that pertains to Europe; this is unfortunately by design. A lot of fundamental research about the release dates of European Game Boy titles is missing. What is available is often only a year, when I want this list to be month by month. There is also a lack of specificity of the European market; a title could have been released in one year in the UK and the next year in France, while never having been made available in Germany.
