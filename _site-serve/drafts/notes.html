<main id="article"><h2 id="pokemon-yellow">Pokemon Yellow</h2>
<p>the game is the lynchpin of the whole situation with the Gane Boy in the late 90s. Nintendo had abandoned Project Atlantis, it was too expensive and power-hungry, and had moved on to the Game Boy Color. In part, they skated where the puck was: their succesful competitors were not making overtly powerful consoles, they were making cheap little things.</p>

<p>Pokémon Yellow was the expression of Game Freak&#8217;s constant difficulties improving their processes. It was yet another version of the original game years after its first release. Everybody was excited about Yellow, and I remember not realizing how much of a rehash it was, but with hindsight you can see how underwhelming the game is.</p>

<p>It was also the perfect game for the era. Pokémon had done solething never done before or since: it reversed a console&#8217;s sales trend. The Game Boy was slowly living its last days in 1996 before Pocket Monsters changed everything. All of a sudden, once Pokemon had picked up steam theough word of mouth, not only were the game sales going up and up, the console itself was going up and up. This meant people were buying a Game Boy just for Pokemon by the millions. the absurdly low price of a Game Boy + Pokemon was certainly the reason for this massive reversal.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-history-of-the-dx-and-deluxe-naming-scheme">A Quick History of the DX and Deluxe Naming Scheme</h2>
<p>When the NES came out, two versions were initially available: the Control Deck, which came with two controllers and <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, and the Deluxe Set which included a cornuccopia of accessories. You got R.O.B. and Gyromite, a grey zapper and Duck Hunt, and two controllers. This was Nintendo of America&#8217;s first use of the word deluxe. Here, it denoted the <em>most expensive</em> version of their console. Note that it did not include <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, which quickly made it unattractive to prospective buyers.</p>

<p>The word stayed dormant until the 1998 release of <em>Tetris DX</em>. Here, the word is reduced to two letters, and gains its current meaning. It now denotes an enhanced version. Other games soon followed, like our game in question, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link&#8217;s Awakening DX</em> and <em>R-Type DX</em>, always implying an improved version of a classic Game Boy title. The full word returns with <em>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em>, a new version of the original NES <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> chock-full of features. Perhaps here, there was an attempt at a differentiation between DX and Deluxe, with DX reserved for Game Boy games and Deluxe for TV console titles.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, both words stayed unused once again until much later, with the 2012 release of <em>Freakyforms Deluxe: Your Creations, Alive!</em> for 3DS. Using a similar golden sheen for the word Deluxe, the game is not exactly a sequel of the original, since it includes everything from the first title. The word thus continued its usage as indicating an improved version.</p>

<p>The Wii U had two versions avaiable upon release: the Basic Set and the Deluxe Set, this being the last use of the word Deluxe by Nintendo to indicate the <em>most expensive</em> version of a console. Later sets including packed-in games would feature the Deluxe word, with the unfortunate <em>Mario Kart 8</em> Deluxe Set clashing with the later release of the seminal karting title. The Switch later saw a <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> Deluxe set, but I believe the set used this name due to the Deluxe Kit DLC for <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> being included with the system.</p>

<p><em>Kirby Triple Deluxe</em> once again used the word deluxe to denote an improved version of an original title upon its release in 2014. We have the current era of Deluxe titles starting in 2017, with <em>Team Kirby Clash Deluxe</em>, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Pokken Tournament DX</em>. The Pokémon Company seems to be enamored with the DX word, using it with the aforementioned Pokken and <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em> in 2020. We saw further Deluxe titles with <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em> and <em>Layton&#8217;s Mystery Journey Deluxe Edition</em> in 2019, <em>Pikmin 3 Deluxe</em> in 2020 and <em>Kirby&#8217;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe</em> in 2023. Of note, <em>Donkey Kong Contry: Tropical Freeze</em> in 2018 did not feature the deluxe wording, even though it&#8217;s a port of a Wii U title with added features, like all other deluxe games.</p>

<p>Digging through history, I think this nomenclature was defined all the way back with <em>Space Invaders Deluxe</em> in 1979, which released in Japan as <em>Space Invaders Part II</em>. Coupled with <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> releasing a couple of years later, those two tiltes cemented the idea of an improved version of a game called a deluxe version. Even though those two games can be seen as sequels, they both add features to the original gameplay, and really embody this idea of a deluxe version of a game featuring new twists on an older game.</p>

<h2 id="true-lies">True Lies</h2>
<p>Why are old licensed games based on movies terrible? Those games have to hit a release, no matter what, so it certainly doesn&#8217;t help. They were also, by virtue of being based on something new, expensive to license. A license like The Terminator must have been expensive to obtain. Those are some of the things that hinder a project even before its begun. But then we come to Game Boy, and <em>True Lies</em>. It&#8217;s a competent game. Nothing extraordinary, but it&#8217;s actually ok. How come?</p>

<p>I have to cover it at some point.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-boy">Virtual Boy</h2>

<p>I should probably talk of the Virtual Boy on the first Wario game after <em>Virtual Boy Wario Land</em>. A better point would be with <em>Kirby’s Dream Land 2</em>: it came out two months before the Virtual Boy, maybe meant as a last big release before moving on. Maybe Nintendo never intended to abondon the Game Boy wholesale, but similarly to the Disk System, they intended to switch their resources to the Virtual Boy to forge a path forward. I would have to check the calendar of releases to see if that checks out. The Game Boy was running out of steam for sure though.
The Virtual Boy uses the V810, an obscure chip from NEC. NEC was in many arcade boards in the 80s with the predecessors to the V8100. It was a 32-bit RISC, so might have inspired them to go to ARM?

<h2 id="virtual-nightmare">Virtual Nightmare</h2>

<p>To understand, we have to go back to 1991, when the Game Boy was a solid portable device that already looked dated. Its styling was stuck in the 80s, with its large size and troublesome screen. However, Nintendo were on a mission to replicate Sony&#8217;s Walkman (hence the similar name: Game-Boy, Walk-Man) by making an ubiquitous device that sold on a <strong>global</strong> scale. Since only a Game Boy could play a Game Boy game, Nintendo didn&#8217;t even have to contend with competition like Sony did with the Walkman. Think about it; any portable tape player can play <em>Def Leppard</em> music, but you need a Game Boy for an hypothetical Game Boy <em>Def Leppard</em> game. Sega, Atari, NEC were incapable of building a market of their own to compete; they tried cramming console experiences in a portable form-factor and the technology just wasn&#8217;t ready, so they failed to make a dent in Nintendo&#8217;s market dominance. Yokoi believed as much; he never worried about those competitors based solely on their use a of a colour screen. He knew how limited the technology was in the early 90s.</p>

<p>Nintendo had free rein to go at their own pace, without any serious competitor in the market. They could simply make more and more grey Game Boy units for more and more markets around the world until they hit saturation.</p>

<p>And they did! The system was a massive consumer success due to its cheap price (only 90$ in 1991, by Christmas 1992 to system had dropped to 80$, and by 1994 it sold for 60$). But Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo president and human shark, wanted another monster hit like the Game Boy: another market-defining device that its competitors could not replicate. Enter Reflection Technology, a small Massachusetts company with a unique idea. Red LEDs were now practical to use in the 80s when Allen Becker, founder of the company, came up with his idea for a display using a single line of red LEDs. A red LED is nowadays usually used to signal if something is on or off: as I write these lines in my living room, two of them are right in front of me. One on my sound system, one on my Wii U.</p>

<p>They could get one row of red LEDs to make their display, but building a whole display out of them was still prohibitively expensive in the 80s and 90s. Instead, they aimed their single line of red lights at a mirror. The mirror was then vibrated in a very precise diagonal motion 50 times a second. The red LEDs then only had to display a different line every fiftieth of a second in sync with the vibrating mirror and it convincignly appeared as if you had fifty lines of red LEDs. Being a very fast light source, the 50hz refresh rate was no issue for the LEDs and it produced no ghosting. Reflection Technology envisioned the technology as a cheap way to make a very small monochromatic display that could be projected directly at your eye. Their initial idea was to make a pager with a tiny hole in it. If you looked through the tiny hole with one eye, you could see a red rendering of faxes sent to the phone number associated with the pager. I know, it sounds terrible.</p>

<p>Gunpei Yokoi saw this screen technology in 1991, already one foot out the door at Nintendo and delayed his deaprture from the company to work on the tech. His idea? Use two of those screens pointed at each eye to create a red 3D image. Nintendo&#8217;s R&amp;D1 division then spent four years basically trying to design a system around the foolhardy 3D idea that managed to keep Yokoi working for Nintendo. However, the mirrors were fragile, the idea was unmarketable, the monochromatic display meant you couldn&#8217;t really use polygons (<em>Red Alarm</em> nonetheless tried). My source for all this information is <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050016/unraveling-the-enigma-of-nintendos-virtual-boy-20-years-later">Benj Edwards&#8217; seminal article on the development of the Virtual Boy that he wrote for Fast Company</a> if you want to know more.</p>

<p>Nintendo R&amp;D1 fumbled to the finish line, and basically lost four years of work on Yokoi&#8217;s ultimate folly. Four years where they didn&#8217;t design any substantive hardware to help the money-making Game Boy, except the Super Game Boy and coloured Game Boy models (usually called the <em>Play It Loud!</em> Game Boy models after their marketing campaign). The Virtual Boy was released in Japan in 1995 with muted marketing since no one believed in the problematic device. Nintendo of America went about it completely the other way: they launched a large marketing campaign to try and help the device connect with consumers. Neither approach worked, and the Virtual Boy was abandoned within a year of its release.</p>

<p>The story goes that Yokoi, having bet a lot of time and effort on this failure felt ashamed and tried to redeem himself in the eyes of his boss Yamauchi by overseeing the design of the Game Boy Pocket. He then promptly left Nintendo in 1996 after its release to found his own design company, as he had originally planned to do around 1991.</p>

<h2 id="super-mario-land-3-wario-land">Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land</h2>

<p>Chris Kohler À lui que la peur on bonifie allemand vu que les joueurs avaient de la difficulté à appliquer sur le bouton et le bouton à un après l’autre sur la game Boy. Jeremy riche en présumé que c’était parce qu’il est Boy plus lourd que manette de Nintendo. Les développeurs Warriors donc décidé de séparer les contrôles du personnage et de ne pas faire forcer le joueur et sur les deux boutons en même temps</p>

<p>I don’t really buy into the idea that Wario was created as a response to the frustration of working on the Mario titles. For one, his first appearance is as a villain, where he’s supposed to be a bad version of Mario more than anything else. The idea that Wario is a commentary on Mario himself, exposing how Mario is mostly a dumb underbaked concept, came with <em>Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land</em>. So he gained those clear expressive qualities later, not in his first appearance. In <em>Six Golden Coins</em> he reads very much like a straight-up evil Mario, with black versions of Mario&#8217;s power-ups. The world of Mario Land 2 can be seen as a critique of Miyamoto, but not Wario so much.</p>

<p>But he only became a yellow God after his appearance in <em>Mario Land 2</em>. I feel that by the time <em>Mario Kart 64</em> rolled around and Miyamoto himself was forced to work with the character his coworkers invented to make fun of his ideas, my golden boy had fully transcended into his post-modern perfect self. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Imagine that at work someone comes up with a mean-spirited joke about your work output. Like super mean-spirited. And people <strong>love</strong> that joke. They keep repeating it over and over again to the point it becomes a substantial revenue generating concern for the business. Part of your employer&#8217;s money suddenly comes from a joke at your expense. Think about that. Think real hard about the emotional pain of that. How horrible it is. <strong>That&#8217;s been Wario to Miyamoto since 1992.</strong> If Miyamoto doesn&#8217;t have nightmares about Wario to this day, that&#8217;s because he&#8217;s too dumb to realize it. Debate me.</p>

<p>Wario is one of the most clever joke ever played at the expense of someone else. Wario is saying: Miyamoto, your creation everybody loves, this Mario dude well guess what he&#8217;s dumb. He smells like farts. Imagine the exact reverse of your dumb character. He&#8217;s fat, he&#8217;s ugly, he&#8217;s vain, he&#8217;s gross, everybody finds him useless. <strong>And he&#8217;s a better character than your poor attempt at copying Popeye.</strong> Wario is saying: Miyamoto, your creative output is shit.</p>

<p>Fuck. I love Wario so much.</p>

<p>An article about <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/ruthless-capitalism-wario-land-super-mario-3/">the morals of Super Mario Land 3 on Kill Screen</a>.</p>

<p>Wario Land is kind of like the Super Mario Bros. 2 of the series. You pick up enemies and throw them at shit. So Super Mario Land is SMB, Land 2 is SMW and Wario Land is SMB2.</p>

<p>I like the PG adaptations of franchises sometimes kore than the originals: Kabukiman, Clerks TV show. I think there’s something wrong with me.</p>

<p>It’s clear to me that Wario came out of that pressure: they wanted to make a different kind of platformer and the brand of Mario.</p>

<p>It might even be the case that R&amp;D1 was told Mario no longer starred in sidescrollers. Super Mario Land 2 was the last 2D Mario game for XX years.</p>

<p>What to cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The very faint outline of the other sprites, who are way too dark on GBA and DS.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2</em> made little sense to me as a kid in the 90s. I enjoyed playing the hell out of it, but I did not understand what the game was referencing when it was talking about a Game &amp; Watch. I just played the collection of choppy games and initially wondered what the deal was with the classic and modern distinction. I could piece together that the modern games were advanced reimagining of the old games, with more involved gameplay, but I finally understood what a Game &amp; Watch was once I had played the game long enough. Not that I understood by playing the games. I understood because of the museum section you unlock by playing well. <em>Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2</em> unlocks the explanation of its existence with your scores! You unlock viewable demonstrations of the games, with their release dates and a short description of the game. When enough of them were unlocked, I understood that I was playing older, much older video games brought to Game Boy. I finally recognized the gameplay for what it was: it was the gameplay of a Tiger Electronics game.</p>

<p>What a fun thing.</p>

<p>My cousin had the second game and would lend it to me so I would unlock stuff for him. He did the same thing with Zelda DX.</p>

<h2 id="metal-gear-ghost-babel">Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</h2>

<p>Somehow, I&#8217;ve spent my whole formative year watching the dissapointing sequels before the originals. I&#8217;ve seen <em>Ghostbusters 2</em> before the first one. <em>Alien 3</em> was my first alien movie. <em>Robocop 2</em> was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit. I saw <em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</em> first, but I think that&#8217;s the case for a lot of people. <em>City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#8217;s Gold</em> was my first Billy Crystal movie. <em>Bill and Ted 2</em> was the only movie featuring  William S. Preston Esq. and Ted &#8220;Theodore&#8221; Logan as far as I was concerned until I saw the first one in 2020. Finally,I saw Spaceballs before I saw any <em>Star Wars</em> movie. I have to say the transformation of <em>Spaceball One</em> into <em>Mega Maid</em> was more impressive than most of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>

<p><em>Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</em>. I did not have a Playstation, and I wanted to play <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p>

<h2 id="ducktales">DuckTales</h2>
<p>Sometimes, language fails us. There are countless situations that are difficult to explain because the language to accurately describe them <em>isn’t there</em>. <em>DuckTales</em> for Game Boy falls in that category: people tend to call it a port, but it’s not a port. It’s something else that doesn’t have an authoritative word. I would call it a version of the game, but it’s a word with a large meaning that can still imply that it’s a port. The closest I can get to is reimagining.</p>

<p>Those discussions about what <em>DuckTales</em> is makes it essential.</p>

<h2 id="halfway-there">Halfway There</h2>

<p>Scrooge is 30% smaller.
<em>DuckTales</em> is not simply a cartoon or a game: it’s a Disney brand.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve talked about Mega Man I and II on Game Boy before. Those games were released <strong>AFTER</strong> Ducktales and are not as good. They were done by contracted developers and feature polarizing design decisions. Mega Man is exactly the same sprite size as on NES, meaning you have a small area around you to jump and walk around in because the Game Boy as a smaller resolution than a TV. Capcom very obviously released Mega Man games on Game Boy as an afterthought, and gave attention and care to their current adaptations on Game Boy. Ducktales was released concurrently with its NES release, not as a catching up with the numbers.</p>

<p>So the stewards of the duck tales project were obviously concerned with making the Game Boy version reasonably good. The father of Mega Man was merely content to give his child to a third-party developer who had done one game on Game Boy already and then not trust them with the number 2 game in the series, arguably the most important because everybody even back then knew that Mega Man 2 was THE good game in the series.</p>

<p>Doing Game Boy Essentials, I had many objectives I wanted to achieve. One of them was not treating companies as the makers of the games. What do I mean? That for example Starcraft was not made by Blizzard, it was made by a group of artists <em>working</em> for Blizzard. I find it incredibly demeaning to the effort and work of those people to reduce their credits to the company they work for. And what about when a company has a lot of churn, and nobody who was there is still working there. Most of the developers of Starcraft have left Blizzard, so its no wonder that they have limited interests.</p>

<p>My humble blue collar roots explain this interest for the working stiff in a video game company.</p>

<p>From my experience, Nintendo, being the game developer given the most scrutiny and attention, they don&#8217;t suffer from that as much</p>

<p>Disney&#8217;s DuckTales on NES is a beloved game by many. The cartoon was a staple of the early 90s around the world (In Québec it was absurdly popular as <em>La bande à Picsou</em>) since Disney had spent a lot of money on this TV cartoon revival. To accompany this massive cultural juggernaut making a TV comeback, Capcom got the license and made a game. Within that context.</p>

<p>Games of existing properties in the 80s and 90s were not seen by corporations as a cultural object. I&#8217;m sure the executives at Disney approached the DuckTales game like they approached the beach towels with Scrooge McDuck on them: they were an ancillary product meant to increase the brand recognition of the main product, the TV show. Disney has always been very hands-on in their approach</p>

<p>The cane is the result of Disney forbidding Capcom from having Scrooge McDuck directly hitting the enemies of the game. He could not use a gun, he could not directly attack enemies. The violence of Scrooge McDuck had to be incidental. It&#8217;s a miracle the people at Capcom figured out a way to do it.</p>

<p>Disney is particularly known for understanding that their ancillary products have to faithfully represent the original material. In other words, they keep a very tight reign over their properties. It is an often repeated fact that Ducktales on NES features the cane as a pogo trick because Disney would not allow Scrooge McDuck to directly hit enemies. How do constraints of this type relate to the Game Boy version of Ducktales? I believe that Capcom never got anything different aprroved for there Game Boy versions. The same sprites, the same level types, the same enemy designs, the same overall game concepts were presented to Disney and sold as the Ducktales game concepts for NES. Disney approved them and Capcom proceeded to make the NES version with those approvals and then use those same approvals for the Game Boy version. The differences between the games to me definetely feel like the things that would be the details left to Capcom that Disney did not have to approve. A saucer level on the moon, Transylvanai,  treasures and enemy sprites are all reused; things that I presume Disney had a hand in ok-ing. The differences lie in what Capcom was left to do. The level concept was probably approved, but not necessiraly the minuatiae of the level design. So Capcom could change that with the Game Boy version.</p>

<p>All that or Capacom just honestly though that it was absolutely ok to reuse the same sprites on Game Boy. I think it&#8217;s proabobaly a little of both.</p>

<p>http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/disneynes/disneynes2.htm</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to talk too much about how the game is; I want to talk about the world in which it came to be. The technical.</p>

<p>To a lot of people who are dismissive of Game Boy as a serious gaming system worthy of scrutiny, it seems that is all the Game Boy was: <em>ports</em> of NES games.</p>

<p>I would argue that historically, Donkey Kong &#8216;94 is the most important Mario game in terms of design. It made Nintendo learn that Mario&#8217;s mechanics could be used for a strictly puzzle-based game where you need to explore options to achieve success. Those lessons were taken to heart and applied to Super Mario 64.</p>

<p>The enemies in this game act like the ones in Super Mario 64. They&#8217;re hindrances instead of being the main attraction.</p>

<h2 id="final-fantasy-legend-ii">Final Fantasy Legend II</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m kind of pissed. I should have bought that one instead of the first one when I was a kid.</p>

<p>If you, like me, initially hoped that <em>Final Fantasy Legend 2</em> would answer the question of where</p>

<h2 id="great-greed">Great Greed</h2>

<p><em>Great Greed</em> is not a particularly interesting game. It&#8217;s an unremarkable RPG in every sense. Knowing this, I can state for a fact that my wife is the person that has enjoyed <em>Great Greed</em> the most. No one has gotten more pleasure out of <em>Great Greed</em> than her, and she has never played it. This makes this game essential.</p>

<p>How can my wife, without having played <em>Great Greed</em>, even qualify for such a strange achievement? You have to start by knowing that my wife and I love shitty movies that are so bad they&#8217;re good. Those movies made by people who didn&#8217;t know any better. Movies like a train wreck that captures your attention with their horror. We both love seminal classic <em>The Room</em>, I enjoy <em>Neil Breen</em> very much and I am a unrepetent fan of <em>THE</em> (hack frauds)[].</p>

<p>I have never laughed more at a video game than playing <em>Great Greed</em>. I don&#8217;t believe anyone else could come close to enj</p>

<p>Lola Leftover</p>

<p>You feel like It breaks the barrier of reality. It’s hard to understand what it does to your mind. It is the funniest game I have played in my life. Out of pure coincidence, my wife was watching me play the game and we both could not stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the game.</p>

<p>There is no <em>canonical big Japanese RPG</em> on Game Boy. On SNES you have Final Fantasy IV, on NES you have Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior, on Sega systems you had Phatasy Star.</p>

<p>Big games with meaty stories, long playtime and relatively tame design systems. All RPGs on Game Boy have something incredibly weird about them. Great Greed fits right into this grand tradition.</p>

<h2 id="links-awakening-dx">Link&#8217;s Awakening DX</h2>

<p>My cousin was asking me to open up the game for him. Why ? Because it&#8217;s convoluted.</p>

<p>Straw millionaire quest being mandatory
The powder used for talon
Etc.</p>

<p>Thinking about my last article got me thinking way more about how difficult it truly is.</p>

<p>The game was lent to me and then I played it on a DMG. Then I bought a Color after giving the game back. Then I waited more than a decade before buying DX and finally, finally going to the secret colour dungeon. Let me tell you: it is hella underwhelming.</p>

<h2 id="mega-man-iv">Mega Man IV</h2>

<p>MINAKUCHI ENGINEERING DEVELOPED MEGA MAN X3!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve thought about Rockman a bit more. He&#8217;s simply Astro Boy. Games start with sorrow. He&#8217;s just a little boy robot who wants to be left alone. Then the call to action and suddenly you&#8217;re on. In Mega Man 2 on Nes the call to action is you literally pressing start. He puts on his helmet and off he goes to fight the evil Dr. Wily. It&#8217;s a perfect video game premise. The Game Boy games have none of that simple premise.</p>

<p>Compared to 4, 2 feels like a collection of tileset mushed together.</p>

<p>Them slowdowns. They&#8217;re there to help though.</p>

<p>Played it figured it was going to be easy with all the stuff given to you but no, you mostly die from the pits. Bit of a shame. Hard in a kind of unfair way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a polished gem. All the edges have been sanded-off to give you a clean, complex, difficult and rewarding experience. They got it right on the fourth try !</p>

<p>The last segment of the game, after all 8 robot masters, is as is tradition, lacking in saves. Which is a shame for a Game Boy title, considering it is very lax with its continues, putting you right on top of the action.</p>

<p>Note on price. Do not pay those atrocious US prices.</p>

<h2 id="megaman-xtreme">Megaman Xtreme</h2>

<p>Compare sliding versus dashing
How X is more about movement and firepower than Mega Man; he&#8217;s not putt-putting along.
Smaller sprite for X on GB
What are the portals all over levels doing?
It kind of doesn&#8217;t stick the landing, it&#8217;s not all that great.</p>

<h2 id="pokémon-crystal-version">Pokémon Crystal Version</h2>

<p>Pokémon is like the Game Boy itself; it is backward compatible with the previous generation.</p>

<p>You have this story of chose président heroically coming in to make a compression system for the game allowing making them suddenly realize to put in Kanto. I don&#8217;t buy it. He was a fixer, sent in to rescue troubled projects. I think they were on path for the game to be shorter then the original and he came in and helped them build a compression system so they could make it as big as they wanted.</p>

<p>I truly believe the game is awesome but there are so many different ways to approach a sequel; no backward compat with a new engine maybe could have been great.</p>

<h2 id="resident-evil-gaiden">Resident Evil Gaiden</h2>

<p>Resident Evil Gaiden came out of the <em>let&#8217;s do something that shouldn&#8217;t be done</em> trend that happened at the end of the Game Boy Color&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s the trend that brought us such flawed games as <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic I &amp; II</em>, <em>Warlocked</em>, <em>Alone in the Dark</em> &amp; <em>Toy Story Racer</em>. However, Resident Evil Gaiden itself is not a part of the trend; instead, it is the game that replaced the game that was a part of this movement. You see, a developer by the name of XXX convinced Capcom that it was a good idea to bring their original Playstation game Resident Evil to Game Boy Color. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>Emulators are a dangerous tool; they sometimes tell you the wrong thing about a game. Put in Resident Evil Gaiden in OpenEmu or something on Windows for you lower forms of computer user and you get the impression Resident Evil Gaiden is a failed idea. Put it in your Game Boy Color, shove that thing in your face like you need to do and you get Resident Evil between your palms. A weird Resident Evil, but nonetheless it kind of works.</p>

<p>Resident evil Gaiden does not keep track of which enemies&#8217;s UF killed. It will instead feature the old time way of if you go down one screen and go back up immediately be two zombies that you just killed we&#8217;ll will have reappeared. This completely changes your relationship with enemies in the game The PlayStation original will kind of have you be a bullet delivery mechanism where since enemies die once you have children and stay dead you will choose which enemies to kill with your gun and which enemies to kill with your knife to preserve ammo or which enemies to just not bother killing because they are out of your way. Here you will always choose not to kill enemies if you can because they bringing you know benefit. Dead enemies are simply dead until you&#8217;ve left the screen so you have no incentive to kill any enemy. This is completely changes your approach to the game and this is definitely not something that a modern game would change. But since the game was made into thousand and one what looked good on the box and what could easily be achieved was good enough a modern game that is inspired by resident evil would definitely keep the zombies stay dead mechanic at parentheses the place the GameCube resident evil remake famously played with that mechanic to fuck you##Revelations: The Demon Slayer</p>

<p>Jeremy Parish once said the Game Boy Color had weird washed out pastel colors as its palette: he wasn&#8217;t wrong. To me, those colors evoke a very specific idea. They&#8217;re not necessarily ugly.</p>

<p>But Revelations the Demon slayer has one ugly color palette.</p>

<h2 id="super-mario-bros-deluxe">Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</h2>

<h2 id="crisp-gameplay-since-1985">Crisp gameplay since 1985</h2>

<p>I used to hate Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Now I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate it a lot. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe truly put the pedal to the metal with the Game Boy Color. Before it came out, the Game Boy Color had been out for six months but the games that came out for it were all half-measures. They were black cartridges, games that could also be played on a regular Game Boy without any problems. Those games were all testing the water of the Game Boy Color. They stuck to the tricks they knew to make a Game Boy title easy to see on an original grey DMG and then added a colour palette if you happened to play it on a Game Boy Color. On top of that, by their nature of being backwards-compatible titles, they could not get access to the 8.388 MHz speed of the Game Boy Color; they were stuck at 4.194 MHz and could not use the extra RAM of the Game Boy Color.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note how every video game player seemed to have been clamoring for a colored Game Boy since the first one came out in 1989 but once it finally arrived eight long years later developers were very slow to adopt it full-scale. This is greatly explained by the backwards compatibility. You don&#8217;t want to suddenly abandon the largest console market ever because a new uncertain Game Boy is out. So you make backwards-compatible black cartridges to cover all your bases. Even Nintendo did this: Tetris DX, that came out the day the Game Boy Color arrived and is arguably the standard-bearer of the new console is a black cartridge. But Nintendo knew they had to blaze the trail. It&#8217;s under this context that they made Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. It is not a backwards-compatible game; only a Game Boy Color can play this extremely faithful port of the game.</p>

<h2 id="love">Love</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve read somewhere that they&#8217;ve tightened the controls so I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>They added a bunch of little sounds to help you figure out what&#8217;s happening around you that you can&#8217;t see.</p>

<h2 id="hate">Hate</h2>

<p>An excellent example of the game&#8217;s design as a portable Super Mario for people who had played it before are the Hammer Bros. They are arguably the hardest thing in the game because you have to work hard to manage your position in relation to theirs and wait for an opening but because the screen is so small you can&#8217;t adequately do it. They are most difficult when accompanied by their twin platforms and when the screen is in its normal position, you cannot see if any Hammer Bros. is on the topmost platform. How are you supposed to manage how to make your way through their dual barrage of hammers to hit one of them on the head or hit him from under a platform if you can&#8217;t see both at the same time? I&#8217;ll tell you how: practice. If you&#8217;ve played this game obsessively when you had an NES you instinctively know where they are exactly just by looking at where their hammers are. Otherwise you won&#8217;t be able to develop a strategy for dealing with them efficiently with this game.</p>

<h2 id="tetris-dx">Tetris DX</h2>

<p>Natsume / Jaleco Entertainment had done Tetris Plus the year before. Puzzle mode, etc. was made to improve the original Nintendo game. But Tetris DX is different. It was Nintendo going back and changing the rules of Tetris. This basis is still the basis for Tetris to this day, with the rules being turned into the way a game HAS to be built. The Tetris Company will not allow a licensee to change those rules.</p>

<h2 id="hiroshi-yamauchi-supervilain-and-proud-of-it">Hiroshi Yamauchi, supervilain and proud of it</h2>

<p>I feel like I need to talk more about my favourite Nintendo president, Hiroshi Yamauchi. President and chairman of Nintendo Co. Ltd. from <strong>1949</strong> to 2002, the man is a force of nature. Coming into the presidency when Nintendo was still a family business making playing cards and assorted sundry, Yamauchi turned the company into the most influential toymaker in the world. So why do I make jokes at his expense, calling him ruthless and a supervilain? You can&#8217;t achieve something as monumental as <em>creating Nintendo as we know it</em> without being ruthless, and Yamauchi was ruthlessness <em>defined</em>. He was proud of having never played a video game: he only played Go. He signed extraordinary deals for his company like nobody&#8217;s business. He built separate sections inside his company, then pitted all of them against each other, zigzagging around them to push them to best one another. He knew to skate where the puck was going; he turned Nintendo from a toy company to a technology pionneer because he knew video games were the future of toys.</p>

<p>For example, the fact the Game Boy has a Z80 derivative CPU is a total Yamauchi move. Nintendo had built the Famicom with a MOS 6502 derivative from Ricoh, and the Super Nintendo was scheduled to use the next generation of this chip. It would only be natural to get a power-efficient MOS 6502 and put it in the Game Boy. So why does the Game Boy use a completely different architecture that prevents any compatibility? Because they hedged their bets. Ricoh was a small fab, the MOS family was going nowhere, the future was elsewhere and the Super Nintendo still used their chip because they initially wanted backward compatibility with the NES. So Nintendo zigged instead of zagging. They used the best chip for portable devices, ease of porting games be damned.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying Yamauchi is singularly responsible of the Z80 choice, but it exemplifies the company he managed; a company unafraid to silo projects to hedge their bets and come out ahead no matter what.</p>

<h2 id="yokoi">Yokoi</h2>

<p>Yokoi, who publicly for two decades was sold to us as the father of the Game Boy headed the division responsible for it, yes, but he was against its design principles. It makes sense, Yokoi was a toymaker. Making a portable software platform is an incredibly complicated task, even today. That&#8217;s the important word, platform. Something that can be extended beyond what it is right out of the box by other developers.</p>
