Where is the closest camera you own right now? In your pockets? If you're reading this on your phone, you have a camera looking at you right now, and a whole family of high-quality sensors on the back of the very device with which you’re reading this article. The ubiquity of cameras has thoroughly changed our society, from personal communications to police oversight. The Game Boy Camera came out at a time well before that revolution, when a photograph was still an event. The closest peer to this accessory in terms of size and price in 1998 were disposable cameras. [Costing 10$ or lower](https://tedium.co/2018/07/26/disposable-camera-history/), disposable cameras were a democratizing force for the camera world. They allowed you to enjoy photography for a very small initial investment. However, they did not change the fundamentals of film cameras; you needed to pay for film development for all the pictures you took, even for duds you were going to throw away. 

Digital cameras were already available in 1998. With their rewritable media they allowed you to take and delete an infinite amount of pictures. You were limited only by your digital storage space. In 1998 most cameras saved their pictures on 3 & 1/2-inch disquette, which meant you could carry a stack of them with you. However, the Sony Mavicas sold for around USD 800$ at that time; an expensive sum for very low resolution pictures. The Game Boy Camera is a peer of those early digital cameras. It was unique amongst digital cameras for its very low price, which came with absurd limitations that severely limited its appeal. We'll discuss this fascinating Nintendo device in detail, and together we'll discover what motivated the employees at Nintendo to make the Game Boy Camera.

## A Greyscale Camera

<blockquote>When Yokoi Gunpei left Nintendo, Hirokazu Tanaka felt betrayed by his departure, and wanted to prove that people at Nintendo could still apply his lessons to create inventive products. The Game Boy Camera and its printer were born of this desire to show the creativity of the developers who stayed with Nintendo. Yokoi accidentally died before the camera was released, and he his thanked in the credits.<p><cite> — Translated from <i>L'histoire de Nintendo Volume 4</i>, P. 153.</cite></p></blockquote>

Yokoi Gunpei is best remembered as the father of the Game Boy, since he was the leader of R&D1 where the device was developped. When Yokoi left Nintendo in the mid 90s, Hirokazu *Hip* Tanaka, a music composer inside the company, saw the Game Boy Camera project as a way to prove his and his colleagues' worth. They had the engineers to develop future iterations of the Game Boy, but they had lost their superstar toymaker. Yokoi was famous for his work at Nintendo; a rare privilege only bestowed back then upon him and Miyamoto. Miyamoto was a video game developer but Yokoi was something else entirely. He was an engineer and an inveterate thinkerer. Ultimately, he was Nintendo's star toymaker. Yokoi had started at Nintendo when it was still a playing card company, and his wonderful designs gave Nintendo a solid footing when it diverted in toymaking. The stories around Yokoi's mechanical creations were legend. Making a digital camera for the Game Boy would prove that Nintendo R&D1 could still make interesting toy-like accessories without Yokoi.

There was perhaps some internal desire to prove themselves as well. With Yokoi's departure, the R&D1 division was further divided into a hardware and a software section. Okada Satoru was put in charge of the hardware, and no one internally could doubt his ability to deliver good products, since he was the person who defined all the important details of the Game Boy. An engineer who started at R&D1 working for Yokoi, he went against his boss during the Game Boy's developement. Yokoi wanted the Game Boy to be similar to a Game & Watch that would be popular for a *season*. Perhaps a machine that could only play a limited set of predetermined games. Yokoi had the mentality of a toymaker; he focused on building toys that would grab children's attention for a moment before they moved on to something else. It was Okada that wanted a hardware platform that developers could fully program. Something where our waning attention is focused on the cartridges, not on the hardware. Simply put, a portable Famicom. Yokoi relented and let Okada build the Game Boy his way. This highlights the trustworthiness and competence of Okada; he would continue to deliver portable success after portable success until his retirement from Nintendo in 2012.

The Game Boy Camera project was not supervised by him. The software section, led by Hirokazu *Hip* Tanaka, not Okada Satoru's new hardware section, made the device. Perhaps they wanted to prove their hardware chops? To prove they were able to make inventive hardware without Okada and his team?

## Limited Hardware

Released in 1998, *Game Boy Camera* ended up retailling for USD 49.99$, more than twice the price of a typical Game Boy game. Having a camera affixed to the top there, the higher price is easily explained. When you compare to the price of an entry-level digital camera


Upon its release, the device enjoyed a somewhat warm reception. It was featured in mainstream magazines, and reportedly sold more than a million copies in Japan.

First point is how the software poorly accompanies the simple beautiful premise of Game Boy Camera.

Should I do some tests with mine to figure out its focus? How good is it at anything but a selfie? They didn't have the word for that back then. Maybe that would have helped if we knew about those type of pictures in 1998.

## Terrible Software

I'll say it upfront; I don't like the Game Boy Camera software. It's a mess. It features so many baffling interface decisions. People have called it quirky. I have a different word for it: bad. 

[The Nintendo Game Boy Camera Funtography Guide provides a full map of the software](https://archive.org/details/nintendofuntographyguide/page/n5/mode/2up). You can immediately see that there is a lot of things you can do in the software. Outside of *Mario Paint*, I can't think Nintendo had ever made a user interface this complex before.

Upon starting the device, you're presented with a start screen with photos of someone in a Mario costume. This shows one conceit of the software; that it will sometimes use real photos taken with a *Game Boy Camera*. It's not a full design choice. Large sections of the interface use drawn art to represent characters. If you get an idea like that, I'd expect them to use it fully.

My complaint about sometimes using photographs throughout the interface is one of style. However, every other 

We get a complete rookie mistake on the main screen of the interface: they never tell you you can press the Start button to access settings. So on a screen with three clearly written choices, you actually have four.

Let's jump into the worst segment of the device; Play. When you go into this segment, a game of *SPace Fever II* immediately begins. Two enemies drop down from the top of the screen, with letters written on them. Now, those enemies are actually the selection method for the **other** games you can play. So if you shoot those lettered enemies you start another completely different game. However, if you shoot none of them, or miss your shot, *Space Fever II* will begin proper. Imagine that; a selection menu with a time limit.

Upon starting those two other games, you get astoundignly different arranged screens to explain the games. There is 

There are inside jokes when pressing the exit button. The menus constantly change their look; you need to learn everything.
 
The two most sedate and reasonable segements of the software are the picture-taking itself and the photo album. The picture taking features all the controls around the viewfinder, arranged in a intelligent manner that focuses on quick adjustments. The photo album navigation is pretty straightforward, and once you reach the single picture view, all the options are also arranged around the picture. 
 
All in all I think part of the whole mess is explained by the large amount of companies who worked on the project. Creatures (formerly Ape), Game Freak, R&D1 and Jupiter, the company mostly known for Picross are all credited. This is a complete guess, but I think those companies worked on different segments of the software and those were added together with no regards for consistency.

None of the craziness in the software was featured on the box; the box is very sedate, even in Japanese. The ads themsleves, in both Japan and the US, focus heavily on the power of easy photography (duh) and the fun that can be had with the stamps implemented in the pictures album. 
 
When it was released, the Game Boy Color was just around the corner. It was already announced and previewed, and yet Nintendo persisted and released a greyscale camera. 
 
For some weird reason, all the developers of the camera are 

They Poochiefied the software.

We got a surprising revelation in 2020 that highlights the poor user interface design. As a part of the *Gigaleak*, a [massive lotcheck of Game Boy titles was uncovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_data_leak). Lotchecks, in internal Nintendo parlance, are lists of ROMs ready for use in cartridges. They're the [golden masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#RTM). Among this lotcheck was *Hello Kitty Pocket Camera*, a special version of the camera dedicated to who else but Hello Kitty. This whole special version of the Game Boy Camera is 100% complete, yet was **never released**. No one outside Nintendo had seen this before 2020.

We have no information about what the hardware could have looked like, but we can be quite certain no important external changes were planned. Perhaps the camera would have been pink, with a Hello Kitty decal on it. [It's when you load up this golden master in an emulator](https://archive.org/details/hello-kitty-pocket-camera-japan-rc-2) that you see the extensive user interface changes. While all the camera functionnality from the released version is present, nothing from the released Game Boy Camera UI was reused. I'm not versed enough in Japanese to explore the interface in detail but my cursory look revealed a much improved UI. For example, if pressing Start sends you to another screen, you see a mention from the Hello Kitty UI. All the creepy pictures and inscrutable in-jokes have been removed. It's clear the Hello Kitty UI was the second version of the *Game Boy Camera* interface, and this second crack at the problem should have been what was released.
 
## Game Boy Camera Gets A Receipt Printer

Nowadays, people are satisfied that their photos live online, but when they made the Game Boy Printer, everybody expected to get printed copies of every picture they took. You could trade pictures with another Game Boy Camera using a Link Cable, but keeping your pictures imprisoned inside a Game Boy Camera was a non-starter; Nintendo wanted to provide printing capabilities. While Nintendo could have answered with a stereotypically Japanese solution by putting printing kiosks in combinis all over Japan they instead developped a portable printer one could easily buy alongside the camera. This was a great idea in practice, and a marked improvement over *Mario Paint*. I feel like it didn't reach its full potential because it never had any print capabilities outside of *record your art on a VHS tape and figure something out from there*.

So as with the camera came the Game Boy Printer. Connected through the link cable port, running with a whopping six AA batteries and [retailing for the relatively high price of 60$ upon release in 1998](https://christmas.musetechnical.com/ShowCatalogPage/1998-JCPenney-Christmas-Book/0547), the device uses thermal paper just like your receipt at the grocery store. Just like we discussed earlier with the camera, Nintendo knew they had to compensate for their bargain bin technology, so they wisely included thermal paper with a sticking back. This turned bad pictures into *collectable pictures*. 

Just like your receipts the prints also fade with time. No ones goes to a thermal printer for a beautiful, detailed print. It's a cheap way to get something on paper fast and cheap. It will work fine for fun prints to share, but you're not going to preserve your pictures long-term with those prints.

The Game Boy Printer enjoyed a life outside its release with the Game Boy Camera. A few games included the ability to print some stuff; banners, high scores, medals. *Pokémon Yellow* allowed you to print the content of your PC boxes, providing potential relief from all the box shuffling needed to manage your captured Pokémons. When I look at an [exhaustive list of what can be printed](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/916375-game-boy/faqs/35200), I find nothing impressive. Add the high price of the printer coupled with its large appetite for batteries and I feel like anyone who bought the printer was disappointed by its usage outside of the Game Boy Camera. I didn't buy, and still do not own one; when I bought my Game Boy Camera, I did so for 20$, a year after its release in the Fall of 1999. I skipped the printer, which still retailed for its full price, somehow. I don't feel like I'm missing anything, especially since the Game Boy Printer is basically a repurposed receipt printer mechanism.

## Never the smallest

I had often read that the 1999 edition of the *Guiness Book of World Records* deemed the **Game Boy Camera* the world's smallest digital camera. While doing some cursory research for this article, I wanted to read this mention in Guinness directly, so I headed to the Internet Archive's controversial book rental system to read the 1999 Guinness book. [Here is the paragraph talking about the Game Boy Camera on page 294.](https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofre00newy/page/294/mode/2up)

!fig

As you can see reading it, no mention is made of the Game Boy being the smallest of anything. You could perhaps read the description of the PC-21XP described as the world's smallest pinhole video camera and think this applies to the *Game Boy Camera*. Unfortunately, the cartridge does not use a PC-21XP as its camera element. The Camera uses a [Mitsubishi M64282FP CMOS image sensor](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2012/qs44_twc55/qs44_twc55/datasheets/MITSUB_image_sensor.pdf). So the book actually mixes two subject matters into one paragraph, and uses the confusing title *Smallest Cameras*. You could still read the paragraph and believe they simply did not directly write it, but the book actually names the Panasonic NV-DCF2B as the world's smallest digital camera with a viewfinder just one page before. Reading the rest of the section on gadgets, it's clear the paragraph is just meant to describe an interesting device. Two other devices which are not record-holders of anything are later mentioned in the same manner as the *Game Boy Camera*: a lollipop that plays music and a 360 degrees television. 

To be 100% sure, I contacted Guinness by email and they confirmed that the *Game Boy Camera* was never assigned any record. 

!fig
Case closed: the Game Boy Camera was never the world's smallest anything.

Any mention of a Guiness record, even when properly transcribing what is written by Guinness, should be questioned. It's always been a book of factoids and weird trivia instead of a serious reference. Reading anything related to technology feels like you're reading a collection of statements pulled straight out from press releases. How can anyone validate the record for the [most recyclable car](https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofre00newy/page/274/mode/2up) beyond the car company's own statement? Couple that with the extremely difficult relationship between the speedrunning community and Guinness, and it shows a company incapable of understanding video games. Case in point, Guiness removed Billy Mitchell's gaming records when his cheating was revealed and somehow [reinstated those same records two years later](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2020/6/a-statement-from-guinness-world-records-billy-mitchell-621053), **after** he had been unequivocally proven to have lied about his achievements, which led to him [banned from both serious *Donkey Kong* score-keeping organizations](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/premiere-game-scoreboard-bans-billy-mitchell-in-donkey-kong-cheating-scandal/). They also [assigned ultra-specific records to Tommy Tallarico](https://youtu.be/0twDETh6QaI?t=3627) in a clear display of their [pay-for-play record scheme](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/20/552203402/episode-795-is-record-breaking-broken).

To get back to the Game Boy Camera, the wrong information about the record has been on Wikipedia since it was added by an [anonymous contributor in June 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_Boy_Camera&diff=prev&oldid=219108575). You can now find this fake fact mentioned in tons of articles online, on Wikia, probably in a bunch of books. Look at [Digicam History](http://www.digicamhistory.com/) and [Digitalkameramuseum](https://www.digitalkameramuseum.de/en/) for example, two old websites cataloguing the pre-1999 history of digital camera who both carry the false record. I've emailed both to have them remove it, but I predict I will see this false information repeated until I die.

## Accessing Your Pictures

If you're like me, you own a Game Boy Camera with pictures that are decades old at this point. You might even have pictures that you consider valuable stuck on there. My sister had taken pictures of our family dog as a puppy. I wanted a way to extract them and get copies on my Mac. Having already explained how a Game Boy Printer is a poor fit for preservation, other options were needed. Five or ten years ago, limited options existed but we now have a plethora of methods to extract pictures from a Game Boy, from the handmade low-run device like the [BitBoy](https://gameboyphoto.bigcartel.com/product/bitboy) to the exquisite FPGA high-quality device like the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket). You also have the [Epilogue GB Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator) a cartrdige port you somehow plug into your computer to play those games, and something like the [Game Boy Camera Fast Wifi Adapter](https://github.com/MattGrayYes/Game-Boy-Camera-Fast-Wifi-Adapter) a project you assemble yourself using a coterie of parts that you fit inside a 3D printed case. Basically it's a [GBxCart RW](https://www.gbxcart.com/) coupled with a Raspberry Pi Zero. These could all be options you explore to extract pictures from your Game Boy Camera. There are even more options than that. To solve the problem for me, I went and used an Arduino board. Since I'm cheap, and didn't want to spend money on a bespoke solution I'll use once, I decided to use the little [Arduino board I already own to transfer my pictures](https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator#quick-start). This meant cutting up a Game Boy link cable and identifying each wire with continuity. Not the most trivial task, but it was a reasonable task for an amateur thinkerer like me. I was able to adequately mark the required wires, make new ends to plug them in my Arduino (always be sure to plug the ground wire in the right spot) and follow the instructions to load the software correctly and extract the data from the serial monitor. It was immediately successful, with my only issue being the extremely crappy software for the Arduino IDE. They should be ashamed of how many interface bugs they have in their software. 

I encourage you if you have any pictures of sentimental value on a Game Boy Camera cartridge to get the process started to get them out. That cell battery in there won't last forever.

## Conclusion

When I was in high school, I would bring my Game Boy to play between classes or to show my closest friends the latest games I was playing. No one really cared that I brought my old Game Boy to school. When I ended up buying a Game Boy Camera, it felt natural to show it to my friends. I was in for a rude lesson. When I brought the Game Boy Camera to school, it immediately caused a ruckus. When they discovered that my Game Boy could take a picture and immediately show it on its screen, my whole class congregated around my Game Boy, rudely taking it from me. People were suddenly taking selfies, way before the concept was attached to a word, and fighting over who was going to take a picture next. It turned into a pandemonium of excited teenagers screaming at one another to have the camera. A classmate even shoved the camera down her shirt to take a picture of her cleavage. With hindsight, I saw in those five minutes the natural excitement for all the social sharing of pictures we now have in the era of the smartphone. I saw selfies before the word had left Australia, the poutty lips people make when taking those selfies, the incessant sharing of inane pictures you now see on stuff like Snapchat, and even the burgeoning concept of sexting, all with my Game Boy!

That's how starved for cameras my generation was.

The appeal of a cheap camera you could just play around with, that you didn't need to use carefully was hella powerful. I vividly remember not being allowed to touch the family camera; I was told I would probably break it. Everyone I knew had more or less the same experience, where a camera was an expensive tool reserved for adults. Remember, it cost money every time you pressed the shutter button. 

You also had to send the film to be developed, which meant that a stranger looked at every picture you took. It was common to talk about the weirdness of technicians looking at your pictures. That put social pressure on what you could shoot. I totally understand that classmate realizing she could snap her cleavage with abandon now that she knew no stranger would see the picture.

With class about to start, the teacher getting angsty, and me wanting to get my beloved Game Boy back, I ended up in a tussle and pushed a classmate trying to get it back. Falling down, he dropped and broke his glasses. That's right kids; *Game Boy Camera* led me to violence and got me in trouble with my school principal! I was so ashamed I hid the whole thing from my parents and paid for the glasses with my own money.

I wouldn't blame you if you never want to read anything from me again due to this Game Boy transgression.
