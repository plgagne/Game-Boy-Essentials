The Soviet Union is falling apart. Stretched to its limits by incessant military spendings and its stagnant managed economy, what was supposed to be a reasonable political realignment finally broke the Communist Party's ability to maintain power. Its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, will ultimately blame the Chernobyl nuclear disaster for this cultural change. After years of independence movements across the Union jockeying hard, Boris Yeltsin becomes Russia's first (and only) democratically elected president. He immediately starts setting the stage for the permanent dissolution of the Soviet Union once his presidency begins in the summer of 1991. A risky period ensues, with a coup to restore the old repressive order of the Soviet Union in Russia now in preparation. Amongst all this deadly serious moment, the russian computer scientist who invented *Tetris* is releasing a game about sorting hats!

... Pajitnov had left.

Perhaps the difficult times his country was experiencing was affecting him;

Pajitnov had created the most iconic video game in the world, beloved by all. He never saw a dime from its licensing though; Elorg 

What gets confusing is that he worked for Spectrum Holobyte and designed puzzle games there, while the company also made licensed Tetris games. He made Hatris with Bullet-Proof Software, his pal Henk Rogers company.

I'm here to tell you that Pajitnov's third game is, uh, not good. Not good at all. *No bueno*.

Hats are falling from the top of the screen in pairs. Those pairs of hats can be broken apart. If one of the hats falls on a pile, the hat next to it is disconnected and keeps falling on its own. Hats cannot go over piles, so you have to manage how you'll break the pair to maximize piles. 

Let's look at a list of all the Tetris sequels. **This list does not include versions of the original Tetris** like *Tetris Gold*, *Tetris Classic*, or any version called *Tetris* for any platform.
