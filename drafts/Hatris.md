The Soviet Union is falling apart. Stretched to its limits by incessant military spendings and its inadequate managed economy, what was supposed to be a reasonable political realignment finally broke its traditions of severe control and repression. After years of revolt, Boris Yeltsin becomes Russia's first (and only) democratically elected president and he is setting the stage for the permanent dissolution of the Soviet Union once he starts his presidency in the summer of 1991. A risky period ensues, with a coup to restore the old repressive order of the Soviet Union now in preparation. Amongst all this deadly serious moment, the russian computer scientist who invented *Tetris* is releasing a game about hats!
