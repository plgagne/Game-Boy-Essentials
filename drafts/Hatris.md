The Soviet Union is falling apart. Stretched to its limits by incessant military spendings and its stagnant managed economy, what was supposed to be a reasonable political realignment finally broke the Communist Party's ability to maintain power. Its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, will ultimately blame the Chernobyl nuclear disaster for this cultural change. After years of independence movements across the Union jockeying hard, Boris Yeltsin becomes Russia's first (and only) democratically elected president. He immediately starts setting the stage for the permanent dissolution of the Soviet Union once his presidency begins in the summer of 1991. A risky period ensues, with a coup to restore the old repressive order of the Soviet Union in Russia now in preparation. Amongst all this deadly serious moment, the russian computer scientist who invented *Tetris* is releasing a game about sorting hats!

... Pajitnov had left.

Perhaps the difficult times his country was experiencing was affecting him;

Pajitnov had created the most iconic video game in the world, beloved by all. He never saw a dime from its licensing though; Elorg 

What gets confusing is that he worked for Spectrum Holobyte and designed puzzle games there, while the company also made licensed Tetris games. He made Hatris with Bullet-Proof Software, his pal Henk Rogers company.

I'm here to tell you that Pajitnov's third game is, uh, not good. Not good at all. *No bueno*.

Hats are falling from the top of the screen in pairs. Those pairs of hats can be broken apart. If one of the hats falls on a pile, the hat next to it is disconnected and keeps falling on its own. Hats cannot go over piles, so you have to manage how you'll break the pair to maximize piles. 

# A Crash Course in Tetrisology

I intend to write a bunch of articles featuring Tetris sequels, so there's no better time to school you dear reader on the intricacies of the Tetris license than now. 



Let's look at a list of all those strange Tetris sequels. **This list does not include versions of the original Tetris** like *Tetris Gold*, *Tetris Classic*, or any version called *Tetris* for any platform.


|Game Title|First Release Date|Pajitnov Design|Details|
|-|-|-|-|
|*Welltris*|1989 on PC and Macintosh|Yes|First Tetris sequel. It features a 3D well concept.|
|*Hatris*|April of 1990 in arcades|Yes|Stack hats of varying heights.|
|*Tetris 2*|1990 in Eastern Europe on ZX Spectrum|No|?|
|*Faces...Tris III*|1990 on PC and Macintosh|Yes|Assemble famous faces with blocks from chin to hair. The design feels like a sequel to *Hatris*.|
|*Super Tetris*|1991 on PC and Macintosh|In parts|Introduces bombs to remove blocks after each successful cleared line, and objective-based levels. Also includes multiplayer modes.|
|*Wordtris*|1991 on PC and Macintosh|No|Join falling blocks of letters into words.|
|*Tetris 2 + Bombliss*|December 1991 on Famicom in Japan|No|Features the original game and a bomb mode mostly focused on solving specific setups. Not to be confused with the bombs from *Super Tetris*, which work differently. Published by Bullet-Proof Software, Henk Roger's company.|
|*Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss*|December 1992 on Super Famicom in Japan|No|Sequel to *Tetris 2+ Bombliss* with more game modes available. Also released on other platforms but still exclusive to Japan.|
|*Tetris 2*|Starting in Japan on September 1993 on all three Nintendo platforms|No|Called *Tetris Flash* in Japan, it features irregularly shaped falling blocks who are removed through matching colours.|
|*Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss Special Edition*|January 1994 on Super Famicom in Japan|No|Includes different puzzles from the previous game for the Bombliss mode.|
|*Super Tetris 3*|December 1994 on Super Famicom exclusively in Japan|No|Still includes a regular Tetris mode, as well as new variants, this time three of them: Magicaliss, Sparkliss, and Familiss.|
|*Tetris Blast*||No|Nintendo published version of Bombliss from Bullet-Proof Software. Does not include any other version than Bombliss.|
|*Tetris Attack*||No|Straight up *Panel de Pon*.|
|*3D Tetris*||||
|*Tetrisphere*||||
|*Tetris DX*||||
|*Tetris 4D*||||

This list is not exhaustive and final; it's only meant to illustrate my point. What is my point? That Tetris suffered under Elorg. They licensed the name, and paid little attention to what the licensees were doing. Games like *Super Tetris* did not include any sort of way to play vanilla *Tetris*. A classic mode, so to speak. And while players have always enjoyed improvements on the classic formula and variants that spiced things up, there is a fundamental quality with the original version of the game. Introducing bombs or weirdly shaped blocks changes the nature of Tetris. It makes it into something else, and if you just want regular *Tetris*, a game like *Super Tetris* on PC and Macintosh is unsatisfying.

Bullet-Proof Software was clearly doing the right thing with the license, being Henk Rogers company. Their titles, the *Tetris 2 + Bombliss* series, always had a classic mode **alongside** their reinventions of the classic game. Unfortunately, their license was limited to Japan, with the worst licensee to disregard player expectations an unlikely culprit.

Nintendo was actually the worst *Tetris* licensee. Their games never offered a classic mode, with *Tetris 2* being massively different from the original game. They also put the Tetris name on *Tetris Blast* and *Tetris Attack*, two titles that had even less to do with the tetromino-based game. Those two titles have no right to ba called Tetris.

Starting in 2001, the Tetris Company started enforcing stricter Tetris guidelines, which guaranteed any Tetris game had a standardized Tetris version available. This ended the era of sequel games, and frankly made things much better. Buying a Tetris game now guaranteed that you would get a good version of Tetris alongside any quirky improvements and variants the developpers thought of.

Here's the outline of the article:
The Soviet Union is falling already when Game Boy comes out.
So no one bats an eye that every Game Boy comes with a Soviet game; it's in vogue.
Pajitnov starts making sequels because he's kind of forced into it. He gets no money from Tetris at this time.
So he makes his sequels at a licensee of Elorg.
At the same time, other licensees are making their own improvments on the Tetris formula.
But they forget to add classic modes to their versions. They sell games with the Tetris name, but no way to play a classic game of Tetris. Only their variants are playable.
Elorg is not concerned by this. They don't understand.
Tetris has this magical quality when played in its classic form. It's viceral. It's vital. It vibrates. Adding bombs and weirdly shaped blocks detracts from that.
If you want to understand the magical qualities of a good bog-standard game of Tetris, look no further than https://tetris.com/play-tetris/. I'm pretty sure it's the reference version the Tetris Company shows licensees to make them understand what an official Tetris title must contain.
One licensee gets it; Henk Rogers.
Remember, Henk Rogers is the one westerner that Yamauchi trusts like a japanese. He's the one who got Tetris for Nintendo, he's the one who befriends Pajitnov.
He's the one who will found The Tetris Company with Pajitnov in 1996.
The reason he got Tetris for Nintendo was that he already had a license for Tetris himself.
Yamauchi is armed with a powerful tool to win Tetris; the Game Boy.
Visualize this: a Tetris licensee can sell from 10,000 to 100,000 units of their computer Tetris versions for 40 to 50 bucks.
Yamauchi bets on selling millions of Game Boy. And every single Game Boy outside Japan will come with Tetris. The game might be valued 10 to 20$ with each bundle, but Yamauchi will sell around X millions when he stops bundling Tetris in 199X.
I don't know the details but the facts point to him being able to easily outbid the other licensees with generous percentages and advance payments.
Hank Rogers uses his japanese license in the 90s to make a whole series of improved games.
All these games have a classic mode alongside them. Henk Rogers gets it.
But there's one company who fundamentally does not get the need to offer a classic Tetris mode.

Nintendo.

Tetris 2, Tetris Attack, they treat Tetris like it simply means falling-block puzzle. 
The incredible mariage between Nintendo and Elorg comes with a caveat; Nintendo has no incentive to revisit Tetris.
I mean they're right in a sense. Every Game Boy already has a very good Tetris. Why improve it?
They have the license for consoles so what they do is they use it with other puzzle games to gin up their marketing.
I do not know this for a fact, but it's possible Nintendo had a license that includes the use of the name, and the use of the game separately, so if they don't include the classic game they pay less? It's all conjecture on my part, I'd have to ask Henk Rogers.
Tetris Blast to me is the final nail in the coffin; it's Bombliss from Rogers but **without** the accompanying classic mode. That stings.
