Chris Kohler À lui que la peur on bonifie allemand vu que les joueurs avaient de la difficulté à appliquer sur le bouton et le bouton à un après l’autre sur la game Boy. Jeremy riche en présumé que c’était parce qu’il est Boy plus lourd que manette de Nintendo. Les développeurs Warriors donc décidé de séparer les contrôles du personnage et de ne pas faire forcer le joueur et sur les deux boutons en même temps

I don’t really buy into the idea that Wario was created as a response to the frustration of working on the Mario titles. For one, his first appearance is as a villain, where he’s supposed to be a bad version of Mario more than anything else. The idea that Wario is a commentary on Mario himself, exposing how Mario is mostly a dumb underbaked concept, came with *Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land*. So he gained those clear expressive qualities later, not in his first appearance. In *Six Golden Coins* he reads very much like a straight-up evil Mario, with black versions of Mario's power-ups. The world of Mario Land 2 can be seen as a critique of Miyamoto, but not Wario so much.

But he only became a yellow God after his appearance in *Mario Land 2*. I feel that by the time *Mario Kart 64* rolled around and Miyamoto himself was forced to work with the character his coworkers invented to make fun of his ideas, my golden boy had fully transcended into his post-modern perfect self. Let me explain.

Imagine that at work someone comes up with a mean-spirited joke about your work output. Like super mean-spirited. And people **love** that joke. They keep repeating it over and over again to the point it becomes a substantial revenue generating concern for the business. Part of your employer's money suddenly comes from a joke at your expense. Think about that. Think real hard about the emotional pain of that. How horrible it is. **That's been Wario to Miyamoto since 1992.** If Miyamoto doesn't have nightmares about Wario to this day, that's because he's too dumb to realize it. Debate me.

Wario is one of the most clever joke ever played at the expense of someone else. Wario is saying: Miyamoto, your creation everybody loves, this Mario dude well guess what he's dumb. He smells like farts. Imagine the exact reverse of your dumb character. He's fat, he's ugly, he's vain, he's gross, everybody finds him useless. **And he's a better character than your poor attempt at copying Popeye.** Wario is saying: Miyamoto, your creative output is shit.

Fuck. I love Wario so much.

An article about [the morals of Super Mario Land 3 on Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/ruthless-capitalism-wario-land-super-mario-3/).

Wario Land is kind of like the Super Mario Bros. 2 of the series. You pick up enemies and throw them at shit. So Super Mario Land is SMB, Land 2 is SMW and Wario Land is SMB2.

I like the PG adaptations of franchises sometimes kore than the originals: Kabukiman, Clerks TV show. I think there’s something wrong with me.

It’s clear to me that Wario came out of that pressure: they wanted to make a different kind of platformer and the brand of Mario.

It might even be the case that R&D1 was told Mario no longer starred in sidescrollers. Super Mario Land 2 was the last 2D Mario game for XX years.
