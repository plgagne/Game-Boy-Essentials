It is the summer of 1989, and the Soviet Union is clearly falling apart. Stretched to its limits by incessant military spendings and its stagnant managed economy, what was supposed to be a reasonable political realignment finally broke the Communist Party's ability to maintain power. Called Perestroika (Restructuring) and Glasnost (openness), once this policy begins implementation in 1985, independence movements across the Union will start organizing. By 1989, a veritable wellspring of revolutions will start in just a couple of months across Eastern Europe, and the Polish people have already been allowed to vote in a free election, leading independent union Solidarność to enter the political sphere and to start breaking Communist rule in Poland.

During this troubling era, Game Boy is released in North America and no one bats an eye that it comes with a Russian game; it's in vogue. The once evil Soviet populace are now seen as opressed nations yearning for freedom. Nintendo's *Tetris* for Game Boy fits into this new narrative, with its imagery of the Orthodox Church and Russian folklore divorced from the CCCP regime. Less than six months after the release of the Game Boy, the Berlin Wall has fallen and the Communists are undeniably on the way out. So there's no reason to complain about a game with Russian iconography. They're no longer the vilains, they'll soon be our friends.

The jovial Russian mathemathician who created the game, Alexei Pajitnov, is making a new game about hats while this is happening. This is how he starts making money in the video game industry, since he makes nothing from the licensing deals of *Tetris*. His former employer, the Soviet state, is cashing in all the dough and they are not sharing. However, Pajitnov is already very well known for having created *Tetris*, which has quickly become a famous video game. So Pajitnov starts working on new puzzle games promoted with his name. It has a certain appeal; a puzzle game from the creator of *Tetris* must be fun! *Welltris* is being developed at the company that will become Spectrum Holobyte. He also starts working on *Hatris* and *Faces...Tris III* at his Dutch buddy Henk Roger's company, Bullet-Proof Software. Just a year after the release of *Hatris*, Pajitnov leaves Russia to work for Sprectrum Holobyte in the United States. His credited work takes a nosedive, and he ends up joining Microsoft in 1996 to work on games there.

At the same time, licensees are making their own improvements on the *Tetris* formula but they don't add classic modes to their versions. They sell games with the *Tetris* name without a way to play a classic game of *Tetris*. Only their new variants are playable. Games like *Super Tetris* on PC and Macintosh did not include any sort of way to play vanilla *Tetris*. A classic mode, so to speak. While players have always enjoyed improvements on the classic formula and variants that spice things up, there is a fundamental quality with the original version of the game. *Tetris* has this magical feeling when played in its classic form. It's viceral. It's vital. It vibrates. Introducing bombs or weirdly shaped blocks changes its nature. It makes it into something else, and if you just want regular *Tetris*, a game like *Super Tetris* on PC and Macintosh is unsatisfying. This is a problem insofar as The Tetris Company has been supremely concerned about offering players a standard game with everything called *Tetris* since 1996. Since its creation The Tetris Company has forced licensees to make sure it's included. If you want to understand the magical qualities of a good bog-standard game of Tetris, look no further than [The Tetris Company's own free online version of the game](https://tetris.com/play-tetris/). I'm pretty sure it's the reference version they show licensees to highlight their strict rules on gameplay and presentation.

Back in the early 90's, Elorg, the original owner of *Tetris*' copyright, is not concerned by any of this. They're probably more focused on the survival of their state institution in this era of Soviet implosion. One licensee gets it though; Bullet-Proof Software. Remember, this is Henk Rogers' company. He is the Dutch game developper living in Japan with the exclusive *Tetris* console license in Japan. He publishes a series of games in Japan called *Tetris 2 + BomBliss* (for Famicom), *Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss* (for Super Famicom, PC-98, Windows, and Macintosh), and *Super Tetris 3* (for Super Famicom). Those games all include variations on the classic *Tetris* formula but most importantly they also include classic *Tetris* modes as well.

You might wonder why Henk Rogers has the exclusive console license to *Tetris* in Japan, and Japan only? If you have the time, I would recommend watching the hour-long documentary *Tetris: From Russia With Love* from the BBC (it's free on Youtube, don't tell anyone!). You will learn the convoluted story that led us there. Let me try to give the short version:

- Robert Stein, a British software publisher, had a loose Tetris license that he sub-licensed to hell and back.
- Henk Rogers had the console rights for Japan from him, and when Yamauchi Hiroshi, Nintendo's genius CEO, asked Rogers for worldwide portable console rights, Henk Rogers got fed up with Stein's stalling and went directly to Moscow.
- He showed Nikoli Belikov, Elorg's assigned employee to the *Tetris* license, that Stein had sub-licensed *Tetris* for consoles, while Belikov believed Stein's license only covered computers.
- Belikov then had Stein sign a tighter deal clearly limiting his license to computers with screens and keyboards.
- Belikov afterwards hitched his wagon to Henk Rogers. Belikov maintained Rogers' exclusive Japanese console rights, and gave Bullet-Proof Software portable rights, which was then sub-licensed to Nintendo.
- Rogers also got Nintendo of America the console rights in America for good measure.

Henk Rogers was friend with Hiroshi Ymauchi, renown for his stern personnality. Henk Rogers made friend with Alexei Pajitnov and later went into business with him. Without a doubt, his greatest accomplishment in friendship-making is with Nikoli Belikov, who Elorg tasked with reviewing the licensing agreement they had with Robert Stein. They were never chummy, but they were seeing eye-to-eye and trusted one another. Henk Rogers made friends with everybody important.

The traditionnal story of how Henk Rogers outmaneuvered Robert Stein always disregards the most powerful tool in Henk Rogers arsenal; cold hard cash. A Tetris computer licensee can expect to sell from 10,000 to 100,000 units of their computer Tetris version for 40 to 50 bucks. Generously, that's in the ballpark of 5 million dollars in **revenue**, not profit. You need to pay for development of the game. Then you need to pay for production of the disquettes and the box with all the printed material. You're not done! You need to distribute the game. It's expensive to truck carboard boxes across the world. You finally need to pay for advertising and marketing to let people know you have a game. Licensees could expect to give the Soviet state maybe half a million dollars at the absolute most for a gangbuster success, and I'm extremely agressive on the terms. It makes no sense that Robert Stein signed a deal worth 10% of profits. I would presume he had something more generous than what Nintendo ultimately signed.

Yamauchi had already bet on selling millions of Game Boy. The Famicom was a global success, Nintendo was very confident in its ability to sell Game Boys so they were willing to commit to a lot of money. The plan was already conceived to ship *Tetris* with every single Game Boy outside Japan. That's probably why they sent Rogers instead of going the usual corporate route. For the North American console rights, Nintendo of America paid 500 000$ upfront and committed to 50 cents per cartridge sold. For the eight million copies of *Tetris* on NES sold, that's four million US dollars they sent to Elorg. I can't find the exact terms for *Tetris* on Game Boy, but it's very possible Nintendo paid a million or two upfront and the same 50 cents a copy to Elorg. With a reported 29.72 million manufactured copies of *Tetris* on Game Boy including bundles and separate sales, that's potentially 15 million US dollars for that version of the game. Maybe the deal was for less than 50 cents per copy, but I don't know why Elorg would have agreed to lower terms for Game Boy. If anything they might have been higher.

And through all of that, when starting every Game Boy copy of *Tetris*, the first words you see are: *Tetris licensed to Bullet-Proof Software and sub-licensed to Nintendo*. Henk Rogers was making some money with every copy of *Tetris* on Game Boy. Not bad for one trip to Moscow on Yamauchi's request.

# Henk Rogers v. Nintendo: Dawn of Justice

Henk, like I said, uses his japanese license in the 90s to make a whole series of improved games. But there's one company who fundamentally does not get the need to offer a classic Tetris mode.

Nintendo.

That's right. The very same people who immediately understood that *Tetris* would make the Game Boy an even bigger success don't understand that all copies of anything called *Tetris* should offer a classic mode. With *Tetris 2* and *Tetris Attack*, Nintendo treat the word Tetris like it simply means falling-block puzzle. I mean they're right in a sense. Every Game Boy already has a very good copy of *Tetris*. Outside of Japan, everybody who bought a Game Boy already owns *Tetris*. Why bother including it? They have the US console license so they use it with other puzzle games to gin up their marketing. *Tetris Blast* to me is the final nail in the coffin; it's Bombliss from Rogers but **without** the accompanying classic mode. That stings.

- Why is it without a classic mode?
- Nintendo is a smaller software company than you think. Managing their small amount of resources is vital.
- If Tetris is already available on Game Boy, they feel no need to reimplement what they've already done.
- They need to provide new experiences to stay relevant with their small headcount. Once the DS came out, *Tetris DS* was released, the most impressive *Tetris* game ever made due to its inventive game modes.
- But it also had a kickass classic mode. Assuredly mandated by Pajitnov and Rogers, and following the [Tetris guidelines](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline) to the letter.

# Tetris Blast

- developed by Rogers and licensed to Nintendo.
- clearly Rogers saw value in bringing his bombliss concept to Game Boy.
- but since he didn't have the portable license, he signed with Nintendo.
- Somewhere along the way it was decided to only have one mode; the Bombliss mode.
- It's ok in terms of gameplay.
- It's very much its own game. If you removed the use of tetromino blocks, it could work as Bombs Away or something.

... Pajitnov had left.

Perhaps the difficult times his country was experiencing was affecting him;

Pajitnov had created the most iconic video game in the world, beloved by all. He never saw a dime from its licensing though; Elorg 

What gets confusing is that he worked for Spectrum Holobyte and designed puzzle games there, while the company also made licensed Tetris games. He made Hatris with Bullet-Proof Software, his pal Henk Rogers company.

I'm here to tell you that Pajitnov's third game is, uh, not good. Not good at all. *No bueno*.

Hats are falling from the top of the screen in pairs. Those pairs of hats can be broken apart. If one of the hats falls on a pile, the hat next to it is disconnected and keeps falling on its own. Hats cannot go over piles, so you have to manage how you'll break the pair to maximize piles. 

# A Crash Course in Tetrisology

I intend to write a bunch of articles featuring Tetris sequels, so there's no better time to school you dear reader on the intricacies of the Tetris license than now. 



Let's look at a list of all those strange Tetris sequels. **This list does not include versions of the original Tetris** like *Tetris Gold*, *Tetris Classic*, or any version called *Tetris* for any platform.


|Game Title|First Release Date|Pajitnov Design|Details|
|-|-|-|-|
|*Welltris*|1989 on PC and Macintosh|Yes|First Tetris sequel. It features a 3D well concept.|
|*Hatris*|April of 1990 in arcades|Yes|Stack hats of varying heights.|
|*Tetris 2*|1990 in Eastern Europe on ZX Spectrum|No|?|
|*Faces...Tris III*|1990 on PC and Macintosh|Yes|Assemble famous faces with blocks from chin to hair. The design feels like a sequel to *Hatris*.|
|*Super Tetris*|1991 on PC and Macintosh|In parts|Introduces bombs to remove blocks after each successful cleared line, and objective-based levels. Also includes multiplayer modes.|
|*Wordtris*|1991 on PC and Macintosh|No|Join falling blocks of letters into words.|
|*Tetris 2 + Bombliss*|December 1991 on Famicom in Japan|No|Features the original game and a bomb mode mostly focused on solving specific setups. Not to be confused with the bombs from *Super Tetris*, which work differently. Published by Bullet-Proof Software, Henk Roger's company.|
|*Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss*|December 1992 on Super Famicom in Japan|No|Sequel to *Tetris 2+ Bombliss* with more game modes available. Also released on other platforms but still exclusive to Japan.|
|*Tetris 2*|Starting in Japan on September 1993 on all three Nintendo platforms|No|Called *Tetris Flash* in Japan, it features irregularly shaped falling blocks who are removed through matching colours.|
|*Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss Special Edition*|January 1994 on Super Famicom in Japan|No|Includes different puzzles from the previous game for the Bombliss mode.|
|*Super Tetris 3*|December 1994 on Super Famicom exclusively in Japan|No|Still includes a regular Tetris mode, as well as new variants, this time three of them: Magicaliss, Sparkliss, and Familiss.|
|*Tetris Blast*||No|Nintendo published version of Bombliss from Bullet-Proof Software. Does not include any other version than Bombliss.|
|*Tetris Attack*||No|Straight up *Panel de Pon*.|
|*3D Tetris*||||
|*Tetrisphere*||||
|*Tetris DX*||||
|*Tetris 4D*||||

This list is not exhaustive and final; it's only meant to illustrate my point. What is my point? That Tetris suffered under Elorg. 

Bullet-Proof Software was clearly doing the right thing with the license, being Henk Rogers company. Their titles, the *Tetris 2 + Bombliss* series, always had a classic mode **alongside** their reinventions of the classic game. Unfortunately, their license was limited to Japan, with the worst licensee to disregard player expectations an unlikely culprit.

Nintendo was actually the worst *Tetris* licensee. Their games never offered a classic mode, with *Tetris 2* being massively different from the original game. They also put the Tetris name on *Tetris Blast* and *Tetris Attack*, two titles that had even less to do with the tetromino-based game. Those two titles have no right to ba called Tetris.

Starting in 2001, the Tetris Company started enforcing stricter Tetris guidelines, which guaranteed any Tetris game had a standardized Tetris version available. This ended the era of sequel games, and frankly made things much better. Buying a Tetris game now guaranteed that you would get a good version of Tetris alongside any quirky improvements and variants the developpers thought of.
