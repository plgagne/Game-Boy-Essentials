The long road back to the original Tetris
A quick highlight of all the derivatives of Tetris and a quickk history and explanation. Their chase of the dragon.

## A Quick History of the DX and Deluxe Naming Scheme
When the NES came out, two versions were initially available: the Control Deck, which came with two controllers and *Super Mario Bros.*, and the Deluxe Set which included a cornuccopia of accessories. You got R.O.B. and Gyromite, a grey zapper and Duck Hunt, and two controllers. This was Nintendo of America's first use of the word deluxe. Here, it denoted the *most expensive* version of their console. Note that it did not include *Super Mario Bros.*, which quickly made it unattractive to prospective buyers.

The word stayed dormant until the 1998 release of *Tetris DX*. Here, the word is reduced to two letters, and gains its current meaning. It now denotes an enhanced version. Other games soon followed, like our game in question, *The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX* and *R-Type DX*, always implying an improved version of a classic Game Boy title. The full word returns with *Super Mario Bros. Deluxe*, a new version of the original NES *Super Mario Bros.* chock-full of features. Perhaps here, there was an attempt at a differentiation between DX and Deluxe, with DX reserved for Game Boy games and Deluxe for TV console titles. 

Nevertheless, both words stayed unused once again until much later, with the 2012 release of *Freakyforms Deluxe: Your Creations, Alive!* for 3DS. Using a similar golden sheen for the word Deluxe, the game is not exactly a sequel of the original, since it includes everything from the first title. The word thus continued its usage as indicating an improved version.

The Wii U had two versions avaiable upon release: the Basic Set and the Deluxe Set, this being the last use of the word Deluxe by Nintendo to indicate the *most expensive* version of a console. Later sets including packed-in games would feature the Deluxe word, with the unfortunate *Mario Kart 8* Deluxe Set clashing with the later release of the seminal karting title. The Switch later saw a *Monster Hunter Rise* Deluxe set, but I believe the set used this name due to the Deluxe Kit DLC for *Monster Hunter Rise* being included with the system.

*Kirby Triple Deluxe* once again used the word deluxe to denote an improved version of an original title upon its release in 2014. We have the current era of Deluxe titles starting in 2017, with *Team Kirby Clash Deluxe*, *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *Pokken Tournament DX*. The Pokémon Company seems to be enamored with the DX word, using it with the aforementioned Pokken and *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX* in 2020. We saw further Deluxe titles with *New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe* and *Layton's Mystery Journey Deluxe Edition* in 2019, *Pikmin 3 Deluxe* in 2020 and *Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe* in 2023. Of note, *Donkey Kong Contry: Tropical Freeze* in 2018 did not feature the deluxe wording, even though it's a port of a Wii U title with added features, like all other deluxe games.

Digging through history, I think this nomenclature was defined all the way back with *Space Invaders Deluxe* in 1979, which released in Japan as *Space Invaders Part II*. Coupled with *Asteroids Deluxe* releasing a couple of years later, those two tiltes cemented the idea of an improved version of a game called a deluxe version. Even though those two games can be seen as sequels, they both add features to the original gameplay, and really embody this idea of a deluxe version of a game featuring new twists on an older game.
