      "description": "In <i>Centipede</i>, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which are attacking the player in continuous waves. \n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid-fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. \n\n<b>Insect Opponents and Mushrooms</b><br>\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\n<ul>\n<li><b>The Centipede</b><br>\nThe Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\nAttacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\n<li><b>The Spider</b><br>\nThe Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit at closer distances.\n\n<li><b>The Flea</b><br>\nThe Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\n<li><b>The Scorpion</b><br>\nThe Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\n<li><b>Mushrooms</b><br>\nMushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.\n</li></ul><br>\n<b>Game Difficulty and Variations</b><br>\nThe game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:\n<ul>\n<li>One Player\n<li>Two Player Alternating<br>\nTwo players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\n<li>Dual Player Competition<br>\nTwo players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\n<li>Team Play\nTwo players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.\n</li></ul><br>\n<b>Scoring</b><br>\nThe player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:\n<ul><li>Centipede Head - 100 points\n<li>Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n<li>Spider at close range - 900 points\n<li>Spider at medium range - 600 points\n<li>Flea - 200 points\n<li>Scorpion - 1,000 points\n<li>Restored mushroom - 5 points\n<li>Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</li></ul>",

      "description": "While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\n<i>Prince of Persia</i> is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platformer genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.\n\nThe Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.",

The player can also interact with many parts of the background. Using available objects such as springs and crates correctly is often vital to progress. Alternate modes of transport such as Magic Carpets and Skateboards also make an appearance.",

There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.",

The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.\n\nThe game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.",

As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.\n\nIn a change from the original <i>Wario Land</i>, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.",

You must control your height carefully by tapping the 'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up.\n\nIn addition to the single player adventure, there is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete against a friend via the Game Boy link cable.  In this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver their balloon kid into the various level hazards.",

Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost World before everyone else!\n\nAs with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her head.  Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by somersaulting over platform edges first.\n\nThere are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out.  Ellie the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.\n\nEach level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels.  While it's possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'.  A new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.",

You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.\n\nThe local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.\n\nFrom an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.\n\nThe GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.

      "description": "This unique RPG provides a world of fishing as the prime objective.\n\nThere are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise.\n\nThe Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.\n\nRaise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.",

The player has to shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety - this is the Dropzone.",

      "description": "This game features Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy who draws his gun faster than his shadow. Learning from a telegram that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and the Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail, the good cowboy and law keeper sets out to catch them and bring them back across 12 different levels.\n\nPlayers guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items. Some of the collected items are used to get past certain obstacles, such as a red cloth to show to a bull, a bone to give to a dog, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions, and each shot exhausts one of the six bullets in his gun's barrel. Enemies include bandits, bad Indians, or prisoners, each of them requiring a specific number of shots to be defeated.\n\nLocations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and an Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels waits a boss, with all four Daltons being fought one after another in the final level.\n\nSome levels have scrolling-style arcade gameplay, such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or rowing in the rapids. There is also a bonus level where Luke has to shoot all the bottles to get an extra life.",

One is for the direction, but the view for the lure is a side view where the shadow of the fish can be seen as it approaches. It also shows how deep the lure is and how much line is left before it is reeled in.\n\nThere are four fish in the game to fish for - trout, pike, catfish and of course the game's namesake, the black bass.",

      "description": "This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai. The game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The aim of the game is to match tiles. Four of each type are present on the playing field, and when two tiles are matched, they are removed. When none remain, you win. Only tiles that have an empty space on their left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in the impossibility to clear the field. \n\nA light story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs its power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve stages by restoring each animal's power. \n\nSome variants are also included:<ul><li><b>Kong Kong:</b> Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you are too slow, extra tiles will be sent over to your side by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.</li><br>\n<li><b>Challenge</b> (WonderSwan only)<b>:</b> A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score.</li><br>\n<li><b>Goldrush:</b> In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</li></ul>",

In the game you play as Bugs Bunny and you have to find a treasure hidden in an old castle. Unfortunately the witch Hazel put your friends (other Looney Tunes characters such as Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and Wile E. Coyote) under a spell and they will try anything to prevent you from reaching your goal.\n\nYou will have to guide Bugs Bunny through 60 levels in and around the castle. In each level you have to find eight keys to unlock the door to the next level.\n\nYou can collect carrots for more lives and there are a variety of weapons you can pick up to take care of your enemies, including bombs, lightning, cork gun, juice and weights. Other items such as a hammer or pick-axe can help you get past level obstacles. Shields, clocks and shoes will protect you from your enemies.\n\nAs Bugs Bunny you can walk around, climb stairs, use elevators and climb through tunnels to navigate around the screen.",

      "description": "Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as its later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.\n\nTo show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.\n\nThere's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!",

      "description": "Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.\n\nThis is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.\n\nBe careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.",

Playing as Jerry, players have to find Tuffy before Tom does. The gameplay is simple: move Jerry to the goal of each level to proceed, avoid enemies and obstacles (since Jerry doesn't have the ability to kill enemies) and collect cheeses and medals for points. After finishing a level, players can play through a mini game for bonuses. The game's graphics are in 2D. Players can choose to play in one player mode or two players mode. Players can also turn the music on or off. In order to enter a chosen level, players must remember the given passwords.",

Cities consist of six different buildings, which the player has to try and prevent their destruction. If all the buildings are destroyed, the player loses the game. \n\nBoth missile silos are equipped with fifteen missiles each and can be fired independently of each other. Players aim their missiles by moving a cursor to the desired location. \n\nThe Game Boy version of the game was later re-released for the Game Boy Color. This updated version included color graphics and added a rumble feature.",

There are also three missing levels: \"The Swim\",  \"The Coach\" and \"The Jungle\".  The Game Boy and Game Boy Colour version are the same, except a few switched obstacles and the passwords, which are not available for every single level, are for rewarded after different levels.\n\nThe story and gameplay remains the same: Tintin has to rescue the kidnapped professor Cuthbert Calculus; a quest which leads him to various locations over the world. Most levels are basic platforming in which the player has to progress from the starting to the end point while avoiding obstacles by dodging; attacking is out of the question. The action takes place both on the foreground and the background and Tintin can and has to switch between the two plains at any time. Other than that, there are also two 3D levels where the player automatically moves and has to dodge obstacles and a few basic puzzles to solve.",

The goal is always to both survive and collect as many money bags as possible. The amount of required bags to beat a level depends on the chosen difficulty level.\n<ul><li>Underwater snorkeling: Hugo camera is fixed behind Hugo's back and he has to dodge incoming obstacles. He also needs to regularly take new breath which is only possible if he stays in the middle of the screen.</li>\n<li>Snowboarding: Just like in the underwater level, Hugo has to dodge incoming obstacles; just on a snowboard.</li>\n<li>Forest: Hugo automatically moves from left to right and has to dodge obstacles by either jumping or ducking.</li>\n<li>Ice cave: Here Hugo moves over a bottomless pit. The only way to stay alive is to stand on pillars, but those randomly rise and fall. Hugo can move in four directions.</li>\n<li>The fifth level is unlocked after beating the other four.</li></ul>\nThe Game Boy Color version additionally has a training mode which allows to play the levels individually.",

While some of the 150 levels are directly ported over, the majority are new. Another major difference is that the camera is closer to the action, i.e. the levels scroll instead of fitting into a single screen.\n\nThe premise is the same as always: The player takes the role of an adventurer who explores a pyramid in order to steal all its treasures. In each level, the goal is to grab all treasures and reach the exit without dying, which happens instantly when touching one of the numerous enemies or falling from too large a height. Since the player has no attack option besides rarely found daggers, the majority of the game is spent dodging by using ladders or jumping. Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts, teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.",

The game comes with eight different opponents, which are selected from a portrait gallery (8- and 16-bit versions feature different names and portraits).\n\nIt is possible to set up a time limit for a game, and also to customize the game. Amount of starting money, owned properties, houses and hotels can be set for any player before starting. The game also comes with a number of preset scenarios with varied starting parameters. The 8-bit versions have eight scenarios, the 16-bit versions add another four. The Game Boy versions also feature the scenarios, but don't have the customization option.\n\nDuring gameplay, the board is seen from the top. Moving tokens are displayed in a special animation in the center of the board, as is a hand throwing the dice. Auctions and trades take place on special screens, with the 16-bit versions being more elaborately animated and illustrated.",

      "description": "<em>Grime Z80</em> is a remake of the 1984 text mode game Grime for the IBM PC, now ported to an assortment of 8-bit computers and devices all based on the Zilog Z80 CPU.  Like the unsanitary original, it inhabits the general territory of Centipede crossed with Conway's Game of Life: a multi-directional shooter where you battle an expansion of sloppy ooze which behaves and grows like a cellular automaton.\n\nThe little battleship roams the fixed playfield with its infinite supply of grime-destroying bullets, which can be shot in four directions (the game generously does the shooting for you: in the original game auto-fire was optional -- here it isn't).  Mobile enemies travel across the screen and seed new patches of gooey mold; as the muck spreads and mutates, it spawns slimy seepage that actively seeks you out.  You get three lives, which you lose if your ship touches one of the moving spores, or gets completely surrounded by goop.",

The player can move horizontally, and boulders can be obtained from the far edges of the screen.  The player's goal is to toss boulders down upon the enemy hordes, thus knocking them to the bottom of the castle.  The player advances to a more difficult level every 200 points, and the speed which enemies ascend increases.  When an enemy makes it to the top of the wall, the player is tossed to the ground, and the game is over.  Goal is to maximize score.  ",
