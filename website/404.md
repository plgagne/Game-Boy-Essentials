I wanted to have a video here of a Game Boy opening with no cartridge in it, not showing the Nintendo logo but a solid rectangle and weirdly enough the registered trademark logo on its right. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it to properly work with a dummy rom on Higan. Anyway, I guess you better head back to the [home page](/).
