Backward compatibility is popular with console manufacturers these days. Sony and Microsoft both have released consoles that are 100% compatibles with their previous systems. You can buy older games in their online stores, or just pop in a disc from a PS4 or Xbox One and expect the game to run with no weirdness. This feat can be achieved because the PS5 and Xbox Series are upgraded versions of their predecessors, with newer versions of processors and graphics from the same company, AMD. This means that a PS5 can become a PS4 (or a PS4 Pro) and run games without any difference. There are even more complicated efforts by Microsoft to improve the framerate of older titles, to release one disc for both consoles, and to make the experience seamless for players. Those features are now common, but people are not as familiar with them as you would think. I had a friend who had no idea their PS5 could play all their old PS4 titles.

So why am I talking about all this on an article about *Conker's Pocket Tales*? Because this game shows us the worst case scenario of backward compatibility on Game Boy Color. Nintendo really made an effort to make it easy for players to understand how the Game Boy and Game Boy Color worked together, but it could have been far more difficult to understand. That's why *Conker's Pocket Tales* is essential. It shows the path not taken.

## Why is the game hidden?

*Conker's Pocket Tales* has been thoroughly eclipsed by the irreverent N64 classic *Conker's Bad Fur Day*. People might remember that Conker first appeared in *Diddy Kong Racing*, and that Rare then tried making a game featuring the little squirrel. The developers got tired of the premise and changed their happy-go-lucky squirrel collect-a-ton into a foul-mouthed romp where you bounce on the big breasts of sexy flowers, bloodily reenact the Normandy landings, fight your way through the hallway scene from *The Matrix*, and worst of all fight a literal pile of singing shit. It's despicable, and its the point.

Most people will be clueless to the fact that while the cutesy N64 collect-a-thon starring Conker was never finished, the Game Boy version was indeed finished and released! That's the lineage of *Conker's Pocket Tales*; it was the tie-in Game Boy game for the release of *Twelve Tales: Conker 64*. So its forgotten because the game it should have accompanied never saw the light of day. What's even more forgotten is the other game inside the game!

The most common way people will play *Conker's Pocket Tales* in 2024 is by pirating it on a website somewhere. They'll play it in the browser, on some fly-by-night website illegally offering roms in a Javascript emulator. If you play *Conker's Pocket Tales* this way, or with any device that is not an original Game Boy or a Super Game Boy, you will never realize that the game is unique amongst all Game Boy titles.


 or you don't know that using a Game Boy will give you different results than using a Game Boy Color, you will never realize that there are two games inside one signle cartridge. Here's the very first screen of the first level to show you what I mean.

The game starts you in a completely different room? What's happening? There are two versions of *Conker's Pocket Tales*. A Game Boy version, and a Game Boy Color vewrsion. I do not mean that one is in black and white, and the other is in colour, like most black cartridges. Or that some content is only accessible on Game Boy Color, like the Color Dungeon in *Link's Awakening DX*. I mean that the controls are similar, the graphics are often very similar or the same, but that the levels are completely different. The easiest way I can describe it is that the cartridge features both the original Game Boy game and its Color-exclusive sequel in the same package. Which version you get is not dependent on a menu; it depends on which system you play it.

## A Completely Incompatible Save System

Uses the Donkey Kong Land sound effects.

## The GB version
- The game has no continue. You die, you go back to your last save.
- Combat? What combat?
- Nothing redeemable. It's horrible.
- The big walnut says that you now have to beat their game. And then you're thrown to a game of aiming at targets. There are no connections to anything, it just happens. In that moment, I never felt more like the developers directly talking to me. Now play this minigame!
- Which door can you walk through? Guess!

- You're just going from one thing to the other without anything interesting happening. The trees are all the same, the layout has nothing interesting. So much so that the characters just straight up tell you what to do.
