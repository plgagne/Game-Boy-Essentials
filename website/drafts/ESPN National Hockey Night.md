I'm Québécois. I'm a *Bleuet* from Lac Saint-Jean. I have been surrounded by hockey during all my formative years. For all intent and purposes, I should be a hockey afficianado. Yet I have never played hockey, I have never attended a game from start to finish, I barely know the rules of the game, I do not know how to skate, and I do not like hockey video games. While all my friends and lovers were thinking about hockey, I was playing Game Boy. To finally remediate this issue, I have decided to look at the complete history of hockey games on Game Boy. I have no idea why I'm doing this.

This article is ostensibly about the last hockey release on the console: 2001's *ESPN National Hockey Night* by the fine folks at Konami. But really,we'll look at every hockey game on Game Boy in release order and we'll all collectively learn why the last release is worth it. Or not. Again, I have no idea why I'm doing this.

| Game Title | Release Date | Details | Console |
|-|-|-|-|
| *World Ice Hockey* | April 1991 | Japan only, by Athena | Game Boy |
| *Blades of Steel* | August 1991 | NA, Europe and Japan, by Konami | Game Boy |
| *Hit the Ice* | October 1992 | NA only, by Williams | Game Boy |
| *NHL 95* | June 1995 | NA and Europe, by Malibu | Game Boy |
| *NHL 96* | July 1996 | NA and Europe, by Probe Entertainment | Game Boy |
| *NHL Blades of Steel* | May 1999 | NA only, by Climax | Game Boy Color only |
| *NHL 2000* | December 1999 | NA only, by Tiertex Design | Game Boy & Game Boy Color |
| *NHL Blades of Steel 2000* | January 2000 | NA only, by Climax | Game Boy Color only |
| *ESPN National Hockey Night* | March 2001 | NA only, by Konami | Game Boy Color only |

So let's jump in.

The history of hockey games on Game Boy is the North American history of the little portable console itself. You have some rinkydink early games, when the console was still burgeoning in 1991 and 1992. It was successful, but developers did not know exactly what to do with the console. So they ported, with caveats, their arcade titles.

Then games get more complicated, as the same time as they become mere versions of more succesful console releases, with *NHL 95* and *NHL 96*. Those releases dry up, without any 1997 or 1998 release, as the console is slowly losing any sort of momentum. People barely buy any new Game Boy games. Then, a large amount of games come out between 1999 and 2001, due to the massive renewed success of the platform coming from the Pokémon craze. Everybody is crazy for Game Boy Color.

The most involved game of hockey I ever played was *Ice Hockey* for NES and I wasn't even good.

## World Ice Hockey

TEST THE MULTIPLAYER OF EVERY GAME

The first hockey game is *World Ice Hockey*. Released in early 1991, **but only in Japan**, the game was made by Athena, a small japanese developer who overwhelmingly released games that only came out in Japan. Back in the early 90s, a large contingent of japanese companies only catered to their local market, with barely any of their games released outside the island nation. Even games that needed no translation, like *World Ice Hockey*, and could have been successful in North America, the home land of ice hockey. It's fascinating. Did they lack the money to start an American branch? That's a boring answer, and its probably the truth precisely because it is boring.

You know what else is boring? Their hockey game. *World Ice Hockey* is incredibly barebones and simple. It's making me think of my beloved *Ice Hockey* but not in a good way. It's got small chubby sprites similair to *Ice Hockey*, but the ice rink is ginormous. You're supposed to be playing international hockey, which has a bigger rink but this is way too big. The characters are way too small, skate super slowly, and the AI is not very competent. Perhaps the AI is ok; I was playing Canada against Japan and that might have had something to do with it. You see, except for the fact that japanese developers made these games, Japan has no reason to be in a ice hockey video game. The japanese national ice hockey team can't even play competitively against low-ranking teams from the Quebec semi-pro league. So the japanese team's stats in *World Ice Hockey* are laughably low.

Anyway, on to the next game.

## Blades of Steel

The second game is the Game Boy version of the famous *Blades of Steel*. Released in late 1991, this Game Boy version came out as *Konamic Ice Hockey* in Japan. *Blades of Steel* is a side-to-side game, and it has a strong action-oriented feel. Originally released in arcades, the NES version of *Blades of Steel* has a reputation as a solid hockey game. I've always heard it placed at the same level as perennial classic *Tecmo Bowl*. Is the Game Boy version just as good? I played both the NES and Game Boy versions one after the other to figure out the differences and I can't really see any missing features. The shots you take at the net are done with a moving arrow, that goes up and down until you take your shot. This is the core idea of the game, and is present in both versions. What is different between them is the fluidity. The Game Boy version is slower, choppier. Unfortunately, this ruins the experience and ruins this version of the game. Maybe the developers simply didn't have enough time and money to replicate the snappy response you see in arcades and NES. Or, as is often the case on Game Boy, the speed of the link cable severely limited their ambitions. Since *Blades of Steel* is a multiplayer title, the game has to be playable with two Game Boy consoles connected with a Link Cable. Syncing the exact position of 10 characters plus a puck 60 times a second is a tall order for a [one kilobyte a second transfer rate](https://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Serial_Data_Transfer_(Link_Cable)). If you do the math, one kilobyte a second allows you to send 16 bytes every sixtieth of a second. That's not even two bytes per hockey player. I'm pretty sure the game cannot update 60 times a second with that low transfer rate. They probably set the game's speed to be as fast as the link cable would allow. Which is fair but gives you a horrible choppy experience on Game Boy.

## Hit the Ice

Up next is *Hit the Ice*. I first played the arcade game for a couple of seconds and found an interesting game! It's a two-on-two hockey game more focused on antics than legitimate hockey plays. Basically, it's doing the same thing as *NBA Jam*. The crazy thing is the arcade *Hit the Ice* came out three years before the basketball classic. It's even more irreverent than *NBA Jam*, with fictional players that look like they're rejects from *Toxic Crusaders* and a big focus on punching your opponents. It made me think of *Clayfighter* a little bit. Not in style or gameplay, but in attitude. Both games are not taking themselves seriously at all, both are very unfocused. I do not personally like the art style nor the gameplay they went with but I can see the amount of time it took to achieve the desired effect and respect it.

As for the Game Boy version? It's dreadful. *Hit the Ice* for arcades is far from a good game and here you're playing a very poor translation of an already poor game. It's like [Plato's allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave). You're stuck seeing a poor projection of games that exist as lifelike experiences outside of Game Boy.

## NHL Hockey '95 &  NHL 96

Then we have NHL 95 and NHL 96. The fact that they're on Game Boy is somehwat of a surprise. I guess that's when the NHL series by EA Sports hit its highest peaks of popularity. It seems even people with no interest in the sport of hockey enjoyed the series in the mid 90s. It also coincided with the most famous hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky, playing for the most valuable hockey club in the world, the New York Rangers. So you have this great confluence of events that helps to propel Electronic Arts' hockey games. They're on every important platform, so why not try Game Boy and Game Gear versions? They subcontracted small developers to make the games, not even keeping the same development team twice. Then they clearly abandonned the idea after the first year on Game Gear and after two years of miserable releases on Game Boy. If I had to bet, I'd say they didn't make any money on those three games.

Let's talk about one thing that massively irks me about both the '95 and '96 titles: start times. A Game Boy is a peculiar thing; it's a portable console you often play for very short play sessions. Perhaps you have only five minutes to explore the current cavern you're lost inside in *Pokémon*. For that reason it is vital that a game starts quickly. However, a ton of *Game Boy* titles didn't respect your time and take forever to get to the point. *NHL Hockey '95* is the worst example of this problem. Look at all the screens the game forces you to go through before you can start the process of playing some goddamn hockey:

{% include figure.html type="" class="" %}

They even force you to go through the credits every time you start the game! Every single one of those screens has a mandatory amount of time they need to appear on screen but they don't move on without pushing the Start button. This is the worst. I clocked the minimum amount of time you have to waste trying to get through them as fast as possible. You have to mash the Start button for 30 seconds. In the world of Game Boy, that's an eternity. Then you get to the game proper and it's somehow even worse. The game is running so slowly I assumed my emulation was busted. It's even worse than *Blades of Steel*, and it doesn't even have multiplayer to explain its slow tick rate. I assumed the second title, *NHL 96*, would solve all the issues of the first game. No! It's got the same exact slow tick rate issues. The interface is also terrible: I could not figure out how to have a goalie in your net. I'm not an idiot, and the goalie selection screen was completely inscrutable for me. With *NHL 96*, the goalie screen is the same but you start with a goalie, so I couldn't find out how to change your goalie. Supremely dumb stuff.

Since neither of the Eletronic Arts games have multiplayer, they really only have one interesting feature: playing a full season with playoffs. However, the games don't have a save battery. So you have to enter a loooooong password every time you want to pick up where you left off. 30 seconds to start the game, easily two minutes to punch in the 18-character password. Then you start the game and it's a low framerate mess with bad gameplay. Those two games are despicable.

## Conclusion

The history of hockey games on Game Boy is the North American history of the little portable console itself. You have some rinkydink early games, when the console was still burgeoning.

I want to say thank you to my wife for tolerating me, once again. When I started saying my next article was about hockey, she said *it was cute when it was Mario or Yoshi, but I don't even want to hear you talk about hockey*. Ouf.

I want to say thank you to my wife for tolerating me, once again. When I started saying my next article was about hockey, she said *it was cute when it was Mario or Yoshi, but I don't even want to hear you talk about hockey*. Then she told her friends I was writing about these games, and everybody started lightly making fun of me. This article was brought to you after much social hardship. I suffer for my art playing those dumb hockey games, and then people make fun of me for playing them. Jeez.
