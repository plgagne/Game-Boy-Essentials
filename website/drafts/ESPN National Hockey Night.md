I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm québécois. I'm a bleuet from Lac Saint-Jean. I have been surrounded by hockey during all my formative years. For all intent and purposes, I should be a hockey afficianado. Yet I have never played hockey, I have never attended a game from start to finish, I barely know the rules of the game, I do not know how to skate, and I do not like hockey video games. Still, for some reason, I have decided to look at the complete history of hockey games on Game Boy and arrest my gaze upon the last, and best, release on the console: 2001's *ESPN National Hockey Night* by the fine folks at Konami. So follow me, the guy whose hockey knowledge begins and ends with the NES' *Ice Hockey* as I try and figure out how to play those Game Boy hockey games.

The history of hockey games on Game Boy is the North American history of the little portable console itself. You have some rinkydink early games, when the console was still burgeoning. It was successful, but developers did not know exactly what to do with the console.

Then games get more complicated, as the same time as they become mere versions of more succesful console releases, with *NHL 95* and *NHL 96*. Those releases dry up, without any 1997 or 1998 release, as the console is slowly losing any sort of momentum. People barely buy any new Game Boy games. Then, a large amount of games come out between 1999 and 2001, due to the massive renewed success of the platform coming from the Pokémon craze. Everybody is crazy for Game Boy Color.

The most involved game of hockey I ever played was *Ice Hockey* for NES and I wasn't even good.

## World Ice Hockey

The first hockey game is *World Ice Hockey*. Released in early 1991, **but only in Japan**, the game is made by Athena, a small japanese developer who overwhelmingly released games that only came out in Japan. Back in the early 90s, a large contingent of japanese companies only catered to Japan, with barely any of their games released outside the island nation. Even games that needed no translation, like *World Ice Hockey*. It's a side-to-side hockey game.

## Blades of Steel

The second game is *Blades of Steel*. Released in late 1991, it came out as *Konamic Ice Hockey* in Japan. The NES version has a reputation as a solid hockey game. Is the Game Boy version any good? Who knows! I sure don't. I played both one after the other to figure out the differences and I

I got into a fight, won, and my losing opponent was brought to the penalty box. Even I know this is not how referees resolve fights in hockey! *Blades of Steel* is also a side-to-side game.

## Hit the Ice

There's *Hit the Ice*. A very tongue-in-cheek

## NHL 95

Then we have NHL 95 and NHL 96. The fact that they're on Game Boy is somehwat of a mystery. That's when the NHL series, managed by EA Sports.
