I adore *Game & Watch Gallery 2*. I have fond memories of playing it extensively during the summers of 1999 and 2000. My cousin owned the game and he would lend it to me during the long summer days we spent in our respective camping trailers. I played the hell out of the game, maxing out the star count on many of the included games. It's a good Game Boy title; repetitive for sure, but it was perfect for short bursts of play during boring summer vacations. I heartily recommend you play it a bit, even if you think its selection of Game & Watch titles is subpar at first glance. You'd be wrong; it's essential.

## Confused

I've talked before about my puzzlement at Game & Watch devices when I was kid. I had no idea what the name meant, since I had never seen a Game & Watch. I was a bit too young, and from a remote region where nothing cool ever reached us. In my mind, *Game & Watch Gallery 2* was a minigame collection. I could not figure out why each game had a classic mode that used extremely simple graphics with zero animation. Why was the movement so choppy in the classic mode? I could piece together that the modern games were advanced reimagining of the classic games, with more involved gameplay. But what was the origin of the classic games? I sure as shit never saw them on my NES.

*Game & Watch Gallery 2* revealed the history of the old machines as I got high scores in the games. You unlock viewable demonstrations of Game & Watch titles, with their release dates and a short description. Only after improving my English and reading the messages from the hints section did I figure out that Game & Watch was a series of single game systems that the people at Nintendo made in the 80s: Game & Watch was the ancestor of my Game Boy. It always felt weird that my reward for playing *Game & Watch Gallery 2* was unlocking personal knowledge about Nintendo's early video game history. I guess that's what happens when you grow up before Wikipedia's ubiquity.

 ## Staggered Release

Let's do a little sidebar and talk about the arrested release of this game. Initially released in Japan in September 1997 as *Game Boy Gallery 2*, the Japanese release is a grey cart with Super Game Boy support. The Game Boy had been reinvigorated by the 1996 release of *Pokémon* in Japan, allowing Nintendo to release a second slavish homage to Game & Watch in 1997. It seemed to have sold quite well. However, they waited a year to release the game outside Japan. The reason? They waited for the market to heat up. By the Fall of 1997, Nintendo knew that next Fall would be the dual release of the *Pokémon* games and the dubbed Japanese anime, to release *Pokémon* in North America with a one-two punch. So they waited for the arrival of Pikachu in the West to bring this game to our shores. There was one single issue though. The Game Boy Color would be available by then and it would have looked ridiculous to release a game without Color support in late 1998. So the people at Nintendo took the time to have the game properly colourized, which means the Western releases are all black carts to indicate Colour support. Japanese players were never offered the recolourized version.

## Presentation

Upon starting the game, you're treated to a massive sprite of Mario greeting you to this collection. It immediately grabs your attention. Mario even blinks! I absolutely adore the presentation of this game. I already mentioned it with the first *Game & Watch Gallery*, but it inspires confidence to look at such a detailed presentation. It inspires confidence. It tells you that this is not a cheap game collection; this is a curated experience.

You are presented with two sections: the list of games and the *gallery*, where you will have access to messages, a sound check, and a museum. Before we talk about the games, let's look at all the unlockable rewards.

## Gallery

The gallery is where you unlock stuff. To unlock anything, you need to get stars, which are given to you by reaching increments of 200 points in each game up to a maximum of 1000 points. This means a total of five stars. Don't think that you get stars every time you reach 200 points, no! You need to beat your score. If you have 999 points and loses, you have to start all the way back at zero to try and get that last star.

But there's more! Each game has four score counts that each give stars: Easy Classic, Hard Classic, Easy Modern, Hard Modern. This means that each game has up to twenty stars to gather.

Your total star count unlocks certain things each time you reach a treshold. You can unlock a very stereotypical sound check and many written notes explaining details and secrets about the games, with the meat of the gallery being the museum view.  The museum view features unlockable vignettes of Game & Watch games. Those are not playable, only viewable.

This shows you the *Nintendo difference*. Games in the late 90s still had limited memory, and making all those vignettes you couldn't play cost significant time and effort for a Game Boy title. They didn't have to do this, but they did. I'm sure the fact the game was coded by TOSE, and not directly by Nintendo developers, certainly helped to reduce the development cost of all those animated vignettes.

Finally, there is one unlockable game: the first Game & Watch game, *Ball*. Let's move on to discussing each game.

## Vermin

*Vermin* is all about managing your position. Yoshi protects six eggs with two hammers, and three types of enemies with different behaviours are trying to break those damn eggs. Boos only move when you face the other side, with Lakitus and Shy Guys moving at different speeds to throw you off your pace. And pace is the name of the game. Since it takes a split second for Yoshi to bash an enemy, you have to decide where you're going to stand very precisely if you wish to win Hard mode. Yoshi's got a handful of trouble coming his way!

Classic *Vermin* is extremely simple in comparison. It's one of the earliest Game & Watch title, which explains its simplicity. You only move left and right, with four spots that you need to cover with your hammers. The simplicity means it becomes a repetitive rythm game.

## Donkey Kong

Oh hey I know that game! That must just be the classic arcade Donkey Kong game right.

Nope.

It's an adaptation of the Game & Watch adaptation of the arcade classic. So it's two levels removed from the game most people know. Instead of the ordeal requiring precision that you know from the arcade, Modern *Donkey Kong* is based on repeating a quick climb over and over. The gameplay is based on the classic portable machine, so Mario does not jump forward at all, only above his head, and you stand on a discrete grid. Unlike the real hardware, Mario has the benefit of being visible between the spaces when moving. You need to dodge DK's barrels to reach the top of the third ledge, flip a switch and jump through a quick temporary gauntlet to reduce the number of platforms under DK. When they're all gone, bang! DK falls on his head and you switch to the next of three  slightly different levels.

Classic *Donkey Kong* is a faitful recreation of the original little machine, with one major issue: the Game & Watch title used two screens.

They decided to show both screens separately, with a clever twist; a press of a button switches the side

But it's too clever for its own good.


## Helmet

Helmet has you running from left to right, as objects are falling and you have to dodge them. There are five discrete spaces you can stand on to dodge objects. At the rightmost side of the screen is a door. You do not control when that door is open; you have to wait until it opens to go through. Where do you go when you go through the door? Back to the left of the screen to do it again and again and again.

The modern mode swaps Mr. Game & Watch for Mario, and adds a P switch that makes coins appear. Just like *Octopus* in the previous *Game & Watch Gallery*, holding more coins slows down Mario, giving you a greater risk for a greater reward, since you get way more points if you cross the door with a lot of coins.

The game also features a Koopa throwing you the objects, with three different screens with different challenges.

The third screen is only accessible once you reach 1000 points, completely destroying the appeal of that third screen. Why? 1000 points is the maximum amount of points that will give you a star. Past 1000 points, you're only playing for your own edification. You cannot get any unlockable past that. So I have no interest in playing after I *max out* a game.

## Ball

Once you get enough stars, you unlock the secret sixth game this collection features. You start by getting the classic version of Ball, the very first Game & Watch title. It's very simple, especially in its classic form. Coupled with the fact that you can make 1000 points for the maximum amount of points in about 2 minutes, you won't play it for long.

Modern Ball changes very little in terms of structure. It's still three balls (this time Yoshi eggs) that you have to juggle by moving your hands left and right. If you want an example of how fluid animation can change a game a lot, look no further though. The fact the eggs move at 60 frames per second makes it more difficult.

## Chef

Modern Chef is clearly the most complex game of the whole collection. You move Peach around, who's flipping the food prepared by Mario and Luigi. Read carefully, it gets confusing from here. Peach can make the food stay in the air if it falls on her pan. Pressing A or B makes Peach turn around, so you can flip the food from either side. Also, behind her but underneath, Yoshi is following Peach around, and he's hungry. He eats the food that falls on the floor behind Peach. Yoshi will eat uncooked food, but if you flip food enough times, it turns a beautiful cooked brown (it doesn't, but it's all in the minds-eye) and if Yoshi eats it you make way more points. But be careful, you can overcook food. It turns ash black, and Yoshi does not like that food one bit, giving you a Miss. When it happens, you're supposed to keep flipping that food until it disintegrates, granting you no bonus points, but preventing a miss. It's quite complex and difficult.

## Parachute

We finally come to the last game I played, Parachute. Classic Parachute features a helicopter just yeeting dude after dude you have to pick up with your little boat. It's the same placement gameplay as Vermin; both games force you to be in the right spot at the right time.

Modern Parachute is the most visually impressive game of the whole collection. There are lots of colours and fluid movement. There are moving waves, and each character bobs left and right in the wind when falling. To spice things up gameplay-wise, the modern version adds a cannon, undeployed parachutes, three distinct types of falling characters, and a fish that adds an extra bounce when parachutists fall on its head.




What to cover:

- The very faint outline of the other sprites, who are way too dark on GBA and DS.

What a fun thing.

My cousin had the second game and would lend it to me so I would unlock stuff for him. He did the same thing with Zelda DX.
