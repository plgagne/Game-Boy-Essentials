<p>Game Boy Printer Gamefaqs list of game functionnalities
https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/916375-game-boy/faqs/35200</p>

<p>Where is the closest camera you own right now? In your pockets? If you&#8217;re reading this on your phone, you have a camera looking at you right now, and a whole family of high-quality sensors on the back of the very device with which you’re reading this article. The ubiquity of cameras has thoroughly changed our society, from personal communications to police oversight. The Game Boy Camera came out at a time well before that revolution, when a photograph was still an event. There were some sense of revolution in the field of photography when the Game Boy Camera was released; the closest peer to this accessory in terms of size and price in 1998 were disposable cameras. <a href="https://tedium.co/2018/07/26/disposable-camera-history/">Costing 10$ or lower</a>, disposable cameras were a democratizing force for the camera world. They allowed you to enjoy photography for a very small initial investment. However, they did not change the fundamentals of film cameras; you needed to pay for film development for all the pictures you took, even for duds you were going to throw away. Digital cameras, with their rewritable media, allowed you to take, and delete, an infinite amount of pictures. You were limited only by your digital storage space. In 1998 most cameras saved their pictures on 3 &amp; 1/2-inch disquette, which meant you could carry a stack of them with you. However, the Sony Mavicas sold for around USD 800$ at that time; an expensive sum for very low resolution pictures. The Game Boy Camera is a peer of those early digital cameras. It was unique amongst digital cameras for its very low price, which came with absurd limitations that severely limited its appeal. We&#8217;ll discuss this fascinating Nintendo device in detail, and together we&#8217;ll discover what motivated the employees at Nintendo to make things like the Game Boy Camera.</p>

<p>I will call the Game Boy Camera both hardware and software from this point on depending on context. I have a hard time calling it a game or a toy. It&#8217;s somewhat uncategorizable, and this is why I&#8217;m calling it both software and hardware depending on context.</p>

<h2 id="a-greyscale-camera">A Greyscale Camera</h2>

<blockquote>When Yokoi Gunpei left Nintendo, Hirokazu Tanaka felt betrayed by his departure, and wanted to prove that people at Nintendo could still apply his lessons to create inventive products. The Game Boy Camera and its printer were born of this desire to show the creativity of the developers who stayed with Nintendo. Yokoi accidentally died before the camera was released, and he his thanked in the credits.<p><cite> — Translated from <i>L'histoire de Nintendo Volume 4</i>, P. 153.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Yokoi Gunpei is best remembered as the father of the Game Boy, since he was the leader of R&amp;D1 where the device was developped. When Yokoi left Nintendo in the mid 90s, Hirokazu <em>Hip</em> Tanaka, a composer inside the company, saw the Game Boy Camera project as a way to prove his and his colleagues&#8217; worth. They had the engineers to develop future iterations of the Game Boy, but they had lost their superstar toymaker. Yokoi was famous for his work at Nintendo; a rare privilege only bestowed back then upon him and Miyamoto. Miyamoto was a video game developer but Yokoi was an engineer, a thinkerer, a toymaker. Yokoi had started at Nintendo when it was a toy company, and toys were what made him famous. The stories around his mechanical creations were legend even back then. Making a digital camera for the Game Boy could prove that Nintendo R&amp;D1 could still make interesting toy-like accessories even without Yokoi.</p>

<p>There was perhaps some internal desire to prove themselves as well. With Yokoi&#8217;s departure, the R&amp;D1 division was further divided into a hardware and a software section. Okada Satoru was put in charge of the hardware, and no one internally could doubt his ability to deliver good products, since he was the person who defined all the important details of the Game Boy. An engineer who started at R&amp;D1 working for Yokoi, he went against his boss who wanted the Game Boy to be similar to a Game &amp; Watch that could be used for a <em>season</em>. Perhaps a machine that could only play a limited set of predetermined games. Yokoi had the mentality of a toymaker; he focused on building toys that would grab children&#8217;s attention for a moment before they moved on to something else. It was Okada that wanted a hardware platform that developers could fully program. Something where the waning attention is focused on the cartridges, the games themselves. Simply put, a portable Famicom. Yokoi relented and let Okada build the Game Boy his way. This story highlights how competent and respected Okada was; he would continue to deliver portable success after portable success until his retirement from Nintendo in 2012.</p>

<p>The Game Boy Camera project was not supervised by him. The software section, not Okada Satoru&#8217;s new hardware section, made the device. Perhaps they wanted to prove their hardware chops? To prove they were able to make inventive hardware without Okada and his team?</p>

<p>Finally released in 1998, the Game Boy Camera ended up retailling for USD 49.99$, more than twice the price of a typical Game Boy game. On its release, the device enjoyed some muted mainstream interest.</p>

<h2 id="laughable-hardware">Laughable Hardware</h2>

<p>First point is how the software poorly accompanies the simple beautiful premise of Game Boy Camera.</p>

<p>Should I do some tests with mine to figure out its focus? How good is it at anything but a selfie? They didn&#8217;t have the word for that back then. Maybe that would have helped if we knew about those type of pictures in 1998.</p>

<h2 id="hobbled-by-software">Hobbled by Software</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll say it upfront; I don&#8217;t like the Game Boy Camera software. It&#8217;s a mess. It features so many baffling interface decisions. People have called it quirky. I have a different word for it: bad.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/nintendofuntographyguide/page/n5/mode/2up">The Nintendo Game Boy Camera Funtography Guide provides a full map of the software</a>. You can immediately see that there is a lot of things you can do in the software. Outside of <em>Mario Paint</em>, I don&#8217;t think Nintendo had ever made a user interface this complex.</p>

<p>Upon starting the <em>software</em>, you&#8217;re presented with a series of photos of someone in a Mario costume. This shows the core conceit of the software; that it will be littered with real photos taken with a <em>Game Boy Camera</em>.</p>

<p>Menu selection for the games is made as enemies who drop down from the top, which you need to hit under a strict time limit. There are inside jokes when pressing the exit button. The menus constantly change their look; you need to learn everything.</p>

<p>The two most sedate and reasonable segements of the software are the picture-taking itself and the photo album. The picture taking features all the controls around the viewfinder, arranged in a intelligent manner that focuses on quick adjustments. The photo album navigation is pretty straightforward, and once you reach the single picture view, all the options are also arranged around the picture.</p>

<p>All in all I think part of the whole mess is explained by the large amount of companies who worked on the project. Creatures (formerly Ape), Game Freak, R&amp;D1 and Jupiter, the company mostly known for Picross are all credited .</p>

<p>Perhaps if every single screen was like those few games that allowed you to</p>

<p>None of the craziness in the software was featured on the box; the box is very sedate, even in Japanese. The ads themsleves, in both Japan and the US, focus heavily on the power of easy photography (duh) and the fun that can be had with the stamps implemented in the pictures album.</p>

<p>When it was released, the Game Boy Color was just around the corner. It was already announced and previewed, and yet Nintendo persisted and released a greyscale camera.</p>

<p>For some weird reason, all the developers of the camera are</p>

<p>They Poochiefied the software.</p>

<h2 id="game-boy-camera-gets-a-dumb-printer">Game Boy Camera Gets A Dumb Printer</h2>

<p>One of the things people used to expect about pictures is that they were printed. Nowadays, people are satisfied that their creations end up online, but when they made the Game Boy Printer, everybody expected to get printed copies. Keeping your pictures imprisoned inside the Game Boy Camera was a non-starter; Nintendo wanted to provide printing capabilities. I feel like <em>Mario Paint</em> didn&#8217;t reach its full potential because it never had any print possibilities outside of <em>record it on a VHS tape and figure something out from there</em>. While Nintendo could have answered with a stereotypically Japanese solution by putting printing kiosks in combinis all over Japan they instead developped a portable printer one could easily buy alongside the camera.</p>

<p>So as with the camera came the Game Boy Printer. Connected through the link cable port, running with a whopping six AA batteries and <a href="https://christmas.musetechnical.com/ShowCatalogPage/1998-JCPenney-Christmas-Book/0547">retailing for the relatively high price of 60$ upon release in 1998</a>, the device uses thermal paper just like your receipt at the grocery store. Just like we discussed earlier with the camera, Nintendo knew they had to compensate for their bargain bin technology, so they wisely included thermal paper with a sticking back. This turned bad pictures into <em>collectable pictures</em>.</p>

<p>Just like your receipts the prints also fade with time. No ones goes to a thermal printer for a beautiful, detailed print. It&#8217;s a cheap way to get something on paper fast and cheap. It will work fine for fun prints to share, but you&#8217;re not going to preserve your pictures long-term with those prints.</p>

<p>The Game Boy Printer enjoyed a life outside its release with the Game Boy Camera. A few games included the ability to print some stuff; banners, high scores, medals. <em>Pokémon Yellow</em> allowed you to print the content of your PC boxes, providing potential relief from all the box shuffling needed to manage your captured Pokémons. When I look at an exhgaustive list of what can be printed, I find nothing impressive. Add the high price of the printer coupled with its large appetite for batteries and I feel like anyone who bought the printer was disappointed by its usage outside of the Game Boy Camera. I didn&#8217;t buy, and still do not own one; when I bought my Game Boy Camera, I did so for 20$, a year after its release in the Fall of 1999. I skipped the printer, which still retailed for its full price, somehow. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m missing anything, especially since the Game Boy Printer is basically a repurposed receipt printer mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="never-the-smallest-but-cool-nonetheless">Never the smallest, but cool nonetheless</h2>

<p>I had often read that the 1999 edition of the Guiness Book of World Records deemed the Game Boy Camera the world&#8217;s smallest digital camera. While doing some cursory research for this article, I wanted to read this mention in Guiness directly, so I headed to the Internet Archive&#8217;s controversial book rental system to read the 1999 Guiness book. <a href="https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofre00newy/page/294/mode/2up">Here is the paragraph talking about the Game Boy Camera on page 294.</a></p>

<p>!fig</p>

<p>As you can see reading it, no mention is made of the Game Boy being the smallest of anything. You could perhaps read the description of the PC-21XP described as the world&#8217;s smallest pinhole video camera and think this applies to the Game Boy Camera. Unfortunately, the cartridge does not use a PC-21XP as its camera element. So the book actually mixes two subject matters into one paragraph, and uses the inappropriate title <em>Smallest Cameras</em>. You could still read the paragraph and believe they simply did not directly write it, but the book actually names the Panasonic NV-DCF2B as the world&#8217;s smallest digital camera with a viewfinder just one page before. Reading the rest of the section on gadgets, it&#8217;s clear the paragraph is just meant to describe an interesting device. Two other devices which are not record-holders of anything are later mentioned in the same manner as the Game Boy Camera: a lollipop that plays music and a 360 degrees television.</p>

<p>!fig
Case closed: the Game Boy Camera was never the world&#8217;s smallest.</p>

<p>Any mention of a Guiness record, even when properly transcribing what is written by Guinness, is spurious. It&#8217;s always been a book of factoids and weird trivia more than a serious reference. Reading any consumer product record feels like you&#8217;re reading a collection of statements from press releases. How can anyone validate the record for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofre00newy/page/274/mode/2up">most recyclable car</a>? Case in point, Guiness removed Billy Mitchell&#8217;s gaming records when his cheating was revealed and somehow reinstated them two years later, <strong>after</strong> he had been unequivocally proven to have lied about his achievements, which led to him banned from any serious record-keeping organization. At this point, no one should trust Guiness for anything outside of beer.</p>

<p>To get back to the Game Boy Camera, the wrong information about the record has been on Wikipedia since it was added by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_Boy_Camera&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=219108575">anonymous contributor in June 2008</a>. You can now find it in tons of articles online, on Wikia, probably in a bunch of books.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-your-pictures">Accessing Your Pictures</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you own a Game Boy Camera with pictures that are decades old at this point. You might even have pictures that you consider valuable stuck on there. My sister had taken pictures of our family dog as a puppy. I wanted a way to extract them and get copies on my Mac. Having already explained how a Game Boy Printer is a poor fit for preservation, other options were needed. Five or ten years ago, limited options existed but we now have a plethora of methods to extract pictures from a Game Boy, from the handmade low-run device like the <a href="https://gameboyphoto.bigcartel.com/product/bitboy">BitBoy</a> to the exquisite FPGA high-quality device like the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. You also have the <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator">Epilogue GB Operator</a> a cartrdige port you somehow plug into your computer to play those games, and something like the <a href="https://github.com/MattGrayYes/Game-Boy-Camera-Fast-Wifi-Adapter">Game Boy Camera Fast Wifi Adapter</a> a project you assemble yourself using a coterie of parts that you fit inside a 3D printed case. Basically it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.gbxcart.com/">GBxCart RW</a> coupled with a Raspberry Pi Zero. These things could all work, and could all be options you explore to extract pictures on your Game Boy Camera. There are even more options than that. To solve the problem for me, I went and used an Arduino board. Since I&#8217;m cheap, and didn&#8217;t want to spend money on a bespoke solution I&#8217;ll use once, I decided to use the little <a href="https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator#quick-start">Arduino board I already own to transfer my pictures</a>. This meant cutting up a Game Boy link cable and identifying each wire with continuity. Not the most trivial task, but it was a reasonable thing for an amateur thinkerer like me. I was able to adequately mark the required wires, make new ends to plug them in my Arduino (always be sure to plug the ground wire in the right spot) and follow the instructions to load the software correctly and extract the data from the serial monitor. It was immediately succesful, with my only issue being the extremely crappy software for the Arduino IDE. They should be ashamed of how many interface bugs they have in their software.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When I was in high school, I would bring my Game Boy to play between classes or to show my closest friends the latest games I was playing. No one really cared that I brought my old Game Boy to school. When I ended up buying a Game Boy Camera, it felt natural to show it to my friends. I was in for a rude lesson. When I brought the Game Boy Camera to school, it immediately caused a ruckus. When they discovered that my Game Boy could take a picture and immediately show it on the screen, my whole class congregated around my Game Boy, ultimately taking it from me. People were suddenly taking selfies, way before the concept was attached to a word, and fighting over who was going to take a picture next. It turned into a pandemonium of excited teenagers screaming at one another to have the camera. A classmate even shoved the camera down her shirt to take a picture of her cleavage. With hindsight, I saw in those five minutes the natural excitement for all the social sharing of pictures we now have in the era of the smartphone. I saw selfies, the poutty lips people make when taking those selfies, the incessant sharing of pictures you now see on stuff like TikTok, and even the burgeoning concept of sexting, all with my Game Boy!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how starved for cameras my generation was.</p>

<p>The appeal of a cheap camera you could just play around with, that you didn&#8217;t need to use carefully was hella powerful. I vividly remember not being allowed to touch the family camera; I was told I would probably break it. All my classmates had the same experience, where a camera was an expensive tool reserved for adults. Remember, it cost money every time you pressed the shutter button. You were spending film, and you had to pay for the development of the whole roll as well. I sure understand not trusting a child with that kind of strange spending ability. You also had to send the film to be developed, which meant that a stranger looked at every picture you took. It was common to talk about the weirdness of the technicians looking at your pictures.That put social pressure on the content of your pictures. I totally understand that classmate realizing she could snap her cleavage with abandon.</p>

<p>With class about to start, the teacher getting angsty, and me wanting to get my beloved Game Boy back, I ended up in a tussle and pushed a classmate trying to get it back. Falling down, he dropped and broke his glasses.That&#8217;s right; Game Boy Camera got me in trouble with my school principal. I wouldn&#8217;t blame you if you never want to hear from me again for this Game Boy transgression.</p>
