Backward compatibility is popular with console manufacturers these days. You can buy older games in Sony or Microsoft's online stores, or just pop in a disc from a PS4 or Xbox One and expect the game to run with no weirdness on current consoles. This feat can be achieved because the PS5 and Xbox Series are upgraded versions of their predecessors, with AMD processor and graphics chips using the same architecture. This means that a PS5 can seamlessly reduce its capabilities to become a PS4 (or a PS4 Pro) and run games without any difference. There are even more complicated efforts by Microsoft to improve the framerate of older titles, to release one disc for both consoles, and to make the experience seamless for players. While backward compatibility is now considered mundane, it was absolutely not the case in the early 90s. When the Game Boy Color was announced, Nintendo made every effort possible to clearly explain that people could buy Game Boy Color branded games to play on their old Game Boy. That messaging was so succesful that people confidently believe falsehoods about the Game Boy Color. That's why *Conker's Pocket Tales* is essential. Its weird technical workings allow us to really understand how backwards compatibility works on the Game Boy Color.

## Why is the game hidden?

*Conker's Pocket Tales* has been thoroughly eclipsed by the irreverent N64 classic *Conker's Bad Fur Day*. People might remember that Conker first appeared in *Diddy Kong Racing*, and that Rare then tried making a game featuring the little squirrel. The developers got tired of the premise and changed their happy-go-lucky squirrel collect-a-thon into a foul-mouthed romp. Most people will be clueless to the fact that while the cutesy N64 collect-a-thon starring Conker was never finished, the Game Boy version was indeed finished and released! That's the lineage of *Conker's Pocket Tales*; it was the tie-in Game Boy game for the release of *Twelve Tales: Conker 64*. So its forgotten because the game it should have accompanied never saw the light of day! What's even more forgotten is the other game inside the game.

The most common way people will play *Conker's Pocket Tales* in 2024 is by pirating it on a website somewhere. They'll play it directly in the browser on some fly-by-night website illegally offering roms in a Javascript emulator. If you play *Conker's Pocket Tales* this way, or with any device that is not an original Game Boy or a Super Game Boy, you will never realize that the game is unique amongst all Game Boy titles. If you're not aware that it's possible to get different results depending on your Game Boy type, you won't know that there are two games inside one signle cartridge. Here's the very first screen of the first level to show you what I mean.

The game starts you in a completely different room? What's happening? There are two versions of *Conker's Pocket Tales*. A Game Boy version, and a Game Boy Color version. I do not mean that one is in black and white, and the other is in colour, like most black cartridges. Or that some content is only accessible on Game Boy Color, like the Color Dungeon in *Link's Awakening DX*. I mean that the controls are similar, the graphics are often very similar or the same, but that the levels are completely different. The easiest way I can describe it is that the cartridge features both the original Game Boy game and its Color-exclusive sequel inside the same cartridge. Which version you get is not dependent on a menu; it depends on the system you're playing.

Just by looking at the plastic housing of a cartridge, you can know on which Game Boy it will run. *Conker's Pocket Tales* is a black cartridge, which means it's a game that will play on Game Boy and Game Boy Color. I hope I'm not going to surprise you when I tell you that the plastic housing has no bearing on how that promise is achieved. Everything happens inside the cartridge, with the memory of the chips containing the code written by programmers that decides what happens when you turn on your Game Boy.

Programmers were able to write code that checked which kind of Game Boy was running the game. The programmer could then do whatever they wanted based on which console was playing their game. This is how *The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX* was able to give access to the new Color Dungeon when playing on, you guessed it, a Game Boy Color. The game itself knew if it was running on a classic grey brick, and would not give you access to the Color Dungeon.

Now imagine that decision at the very start of the game. If you're on a Game Boy, you can access the Game Boy game. If you're on a Game Boy Color, you can acces the Game Boy Color game. That's how *Conker's Pocket Tales* works, and is in a very small list of games that work that way.

Uses the Donkey Kong Land sound effects.

## The GB version
- The game has no continue. You die, you go back to your last save.
- Combat? What combat?
- Nothing redeemable. It's horrible.
- The big walnut says that you now have to beat their game. And then you're thrown to a game of aiming at targets. There are no connections to anything, it just happens. In that moment, I never felt more like the developers directly talking to me. Now play this minigame!
- Which door can you walk through? Guess!
{% include figure.html type="gb" filename="doors" %}
- You're just going from one thing to the other without anything interesting happening. The trees are all the same, the layout has nothing interesting. The characters just straight up tell you what to do.
- I can't justify playing any more of this boring game; let's switch to the Game Boy Color version.

## A Completely Incompatible Save System

If you upgrade from a Game Boy to a Game Boy Color you are presented with this screen:
