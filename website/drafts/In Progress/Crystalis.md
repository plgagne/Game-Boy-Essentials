# Crystalis

It made me buy a Game Boy Color over the summer of 2000. My mom paid for it so I could buy Crystalis for myself. I guess I had seen the writing on the wall; if I wanted to keep buying Game Boy games, I had to upgrade.

Buying Game Boy games I did with my own money. Very few Nintendo 64 games were paid by me; I instead got them as gifts.

Paper Mario, Super Smash Bros., Conker,
