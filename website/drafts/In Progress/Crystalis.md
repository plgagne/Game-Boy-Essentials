# Crystalis

The writing was on the wall for little Pierre-Luc in the summer of 2000. My trusty grey brick could no longer sustain my Game Boy habits. I would usually buy a new Game Boy title every two months. I had little money, so I would be particularly selective about my choices. I would intensively read reviews about upcoming titles and even with that amount of effort I was not always happy with my options. That's how I ended up buying *Matchbox Caterpillar Construction Zone*. The first reason I bought that game was because it was cheap. I think I paid less than 20 dollars. The second reason: it ran on the original Game Boy.


By 2000, I was still rocking my original Game Boy, the birthday gift I received when I turned four all the way back in 1990. I had been using the same Game Boy for ten years straight. It still worked wonderfully, mind you. The problem was that 2000 was the year 

It made me buy a Game Boy Color over the summer of 2000. My mom paid for it so I could buy Crystalis for myself. I guess I had seen the writing on the wall; if I wanted to keep buying Game Boy games, I had to upgrade.

Buying Game Boy games I did with my own money. Very few Nintendo 64 games were paid by me; I instead got them as gifts.
