A kid in my high school brought it during lunch and he had to explain the game because the title meant we thought it was Donkey Kong Land, then we figured out a bit more and we thought it was just Donkey Kong. That game's title does it zero favours.

I would argue that historically, Donkey Kong '94 is the most important Mario game in terms of design. It made Miyamoto learn that Mario's mechanics could be used for a strictly puzzle-based game where you need to explore options to achieve success. Those lessons were taken to heart and applied to Super Mario 64.

The enemies in this game act like the ones in Super Mario 64. They're hindrances instead of being the main attraction.
