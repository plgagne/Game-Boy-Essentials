# DuckTales
Sometimes, language fails us. There are countless situations that are difficult to explain because the language to accurately describe them *isn’t there*. *DuckTales* for Game Boy falls in that category: people tend to call it a port, but it’s not a port. It’s something else that doesn’t have an authoritative word. I would call it a version of the game, but it’s a word with a large meaning that can still imply that it’s a port. The closest I can get to is reimagining.

Those discussions about what *DuckTales* is makes it essential.

## Halfway There

Scrooge is 30% smaller.
*DuckTales* is not simply a cartoon or a game: it’s a Disney brand.

We've talked about Mega Man I and II on Game Boy before. Those games were released **AFTER** Ducktales and are not as good. They were done by contracted developers and feature polarizing design decisions. Mega Man is exactly the same sprite size as on NES, meaning you have a small area around you to jump and walk around in because the Game Boy as a smaller resolution than a TV. Capcom very obviously released Mega Man games on Game Boy as an afterthought, and gave attention and care to their current adaptations on Game Boy. Ducktales was released concurrently with its NES release, not as a catching up with the numbers.

So the stewards of the duck tales project were obviously concerned with making the Game Boy version reasonably good. The father of Mega Man was merely content to give his child to a third-party developer who had done one game on Game Boy already and then not trust them with the number 2 game in the series, arguably the most important because everybody even back then knew that Mega Man 2 was THE good game in the series.

Doing Game Boy Essentials, I had many objectives I wanted to achieve. One of them was not treating companies as the makers of the games. What do I mean? That for example Starcraft was not made by Blizzard, it was made by a group of artists *working* for Blizzard. I find it incredibly demeaning to the effort and work of those people to reduce their credits to the company they work for. And what about when a company has a lot of churn, and nobody who was there is still working there. Most of the developers of Starcraft have left Blizzard, so its no wonder that they have limited interests.

My humble blue collar roots explain this interest for the working stiff in a video game company.

From my experience, Nintendo, being the game developer given the most scrutiny and attention, they don't suffer from that as much

Disney's DuckTales on NES is a beloved game by many. The cartoon was a staple of the early 90s around the world (In Québec it was absurdly popular as *La bande à Picsou*) since Disney had spent a lot of money on this TV cartoon revival. To accompany this massive cultural juggernaut making a TV comeback, Capcom got the license and made a game. Within that context.

Games of existing properties in the 80s and 90s were not seen by corporations as a cultural object. I'm sure the executives at Disney approached the DuckTales game like they approached the beach towels with Scrooge McDuck on them: they were an ancillary product meant to increase the brand recognition of the main product, the TV show. Disney has always been very hands-on in their approach

The cane is the result of Disney forbidding Capcom from having Scrooge McDuck directly hitting the enemies of the game. He could not use a gun, he could not directly attack enemies. The violence of Scrooge McDuck had to be incidental. It's a miracle the people at Capcom figured out a way to do it.

Disney is particularly known for understanding that their ancillary products have to faithfully represent the original material. In other words, they keep a very tight reign over their properties. It is an often repeated fact that Ducktales on NES features the cane as a pogo trick because Disney would not allow Scrooge McDuck to directly hit enemies. How do constraints of this type relate to the Game Boy version of Ducktales? I believe that Capcom never got anything different aprroved for there Game Boy versions. The same sprites, the same level types, the same enemy designs, the same overall game concepts were presented to Disney and sold as the Ducktales game concepts for NES. Disney approved them and Capcom proceeded to make the NES version with those approvals and then use those same approvals for the Game Boy version. The differences between the games to me definetely feel like the things that would be the details left to Capcom that Disney did not have to approve. A saucer level on the moon, Transylvanai,  treasures and enemy sprites are all reused; things that I presume Disney had a hand in ok-ing. The differences lie in what Capcom was left to do. The level concept was probably approved, but not necessiraly the minuatiae of the level design. So Capcom could change that with the Game Boy version.

All that or Capacom just honestly though that it was absolutely ok to reuse the same sprites on Game Boy. I think it's proabobaly a little of both.

I don't want to talk too much about how the game is; I want to talk about the world in which it came to be. The technical.

To a lot of people who are dismissive of Game Boy as a serious gaming system worthy of scrutiny, it seems that is all the Game Boy was: *ports* of NES games.
