I adore *Game & Watch Gallery 2*. I have fond memories of playing it extensively during the summers of 1999 and 2000. My cousins owned the game and would lend it to me during those long summer days in our respective camping trailers. I played the hell out of the game, maxing out the star count on many of the games. It's a banger of a Game Boy title. Repetitive nowadays, sure, but it was perfect for short bursts of play during boring summer days. I heartily recommend you play it, even if you think its selection of Game & Watch titles is subpar at first glance. You'd be wrong; it's essential.

## Confused

I've talked before about my puzzlement at Game & Watch devices when I was kid. I had no idea what the name meant, since I had never seen a Game & Watch. I was a bit too young, and from a remote region where nothing cool ever reached us. In my mind, *Game & Watch Gallery 2* was a minigame collection. I could not figure out why each game had a classic mode that used extremely simple graphics with zero animation. Why was the movement so choppy in the classic mode? I could piece together that the modern games were advanced reimagining of the old games, with more involved gameplay. Only after improving my English and reading the messages from the hints section did I figure out that Game & Watch  was a series of single game systems that Nintendo made in the 80s. *Game & Watch Gallery 2* unlocks the explanation of its existence with your scores! You unlock viewable demonstrations of the games, with their release dates and a short description of the game. When enough of them were unlocked, I understood that I was playing older video games from before the Game Boy's release.

## Staggered Release

Let's do a little sidebar and talk about the arrested release of the game. Initially released in Japan in September 1997 as Game Boy Gallery 2, that release is a grey cart with Super Game Boy support, as was the style at the time. The Game Boy was reinvigorated by the release of Pokémon in Japan in 1996, allowing Nintendo to produce such a slavish homage to Game & Watch in 1997.

However, they waited for the 1998 release of Pokémon in the West to bring the game to our shores. The Color was out by then and Nintendo took the time to have the game properly colourized for it. So those Western releases are all black carts. As was the style at the time. Had they released the game in 1997 as a grey cart before Pokémon, no one here would have cared and it wouldn't have sold. Such is the power of Pokémon; it resurrects consoles from financial death.

## Vermin

You have to manage positioning. Yoshi protects six eggs with two hammers, and three types of enemies of different behaviours are trying to break those damn eggs. Boos only move when you face the other side, with lakitus and shy guys moving at different speeds to throw you off your pace. And pace is the name of the game. Since it takes a split second for Yoshi to bash an enemy, you have to decide where you're going to stand very precisely if you wish to win Hard mode. Yoshi's got a handful of trouble coming his way!

## Donkey Kong

Oh hey I know that game! That must just be the classic arcade Donkey Kong game right.

No.

It's an adaptation of the Game & Watch, and it is based on a quick climb. Mario does not jump forward at all, only above his head, and you stand on a discrete grid. Unlike the real hardware, Mario has the benefit of being visible between the spaces when moving. You need to dodge DK's barrels to reach the top of the third ledge, flip a switch and jump through a quick temporary gauntlet to reduce the number of platforms under DK. When they're all gone, bang! Dk get brutalized by Mario and you switch to the next of three different levels.

## Helmet

Helmet has you running from left to right, as objects are falling and you have to dodge them. There are five discrete spaces you can stand on to dodge objects. At the rightmost side of the screen is a door. You do not control when that door is open; you have to wait until it opens to go through. Where do you go when you go through the door? Back to the left of the screen to do it again and again and again.

The modern mode swaps Mr. Game & Watch for Mario, and adds a P switch that makes coins appear. Just like *Octopus* in the previous *Game & Watch Gallery*, holding more coins slows down Mario, giving you a greater risk for a greater reward, since you get way more points if you cross the door with a lot of coins.

The game also features a Koopa throwing you the objects, with three different screens with different challenges.

The third screen is only accessible once you reach 1000 points, completely destroying the appeal of that third screen. Why? 1000 points is the maximum amount of points that will give you a star. Past 1000 points, you're only playing for your own edification. You cannot get any unlockable past that. So I have no interest in playing after I *max out* each game.

## Ball

Once you get enough stars, you unlock the secret sixth game this collection features. You start by getting the classic version of Ball, the very first Game & Watch title. It's very simple, especially in its classic form. Coupled with the fact that you can make 1000 points for the maximum amount of points in about 2 minutes, you won't play it for long.

Modern Ball changes very little in terms of structure. It's still three balls (this time Yoshi eggs) that you have to juggle by moving your hands left and right. If you want an example of how fluid animation can change a game a lot, look no further though. The fact the eggs move at 60 frames per second makes it more difficult.



## Chef

Modern Chef is clearly the most complex game of the whole collection. You move Peach around, who's flipping the food prepared by Mario and Luigi. Read carefully, it gets confusing from here. Peach can make the food stay in the air if it falls on her pan. Pressing A or B makes Peach turn around, so you can flip the food that was behind you. Also, behind her but underneath, Yoshi is following Peach around, and he's hungry. He eats the food that falls on the floor behind Peach. Yoshi will eat uncooked food, but if you flip food enough times, it turns a beautiful cooked brown (it doesn't, but it's all in the minds-eye) and if Yoshi eats it you make way more point. But be careful, you can overcook food. It turns ash black, and Yoshi does not like that food one bit, giving you a Miss. It's quite complex and difficult.

## Parachute

It's the most arresting visually. There are lots of colours.



Helmet is the Dark Souls of Game & Watch games.

What to cover:

- The very faint outline of the other sprites, who are way too dark on GBA and DS.

What a fun thing.

My cousin had the second game and would lend it to me so I would unlock stuff for him. He did the same thing with Zelda DX.
