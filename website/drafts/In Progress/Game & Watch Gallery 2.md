# Game & Watch Gallery 2

I adore *Game & Watch Gallery 2*. I've played it extensively during the summer of 1999 and 2000. My cousins owned the game and they would lend it to me during those long summers in our respective camping trailers. I played the hell out of the game, maxing out the star count on many of the games. 




I've talked before about my puzzlement at Game & Watch devices when I was kid. I had no idea what the name meant, since I had never seen a Game & Watch. I was a bit too young, and especially from a far too remote region to have ever seen one. So in my mind, *Game & Watch Gallery 2* was a minigame collection. I never managed to figure out why each game had a classic mode that used extremely simple graphics. I could not firgure out why the movement was so choppy in the classic mode.

Only after getting better at English and reading the messages from the hints section did I figure out that Game & Watch were older single game systems that Nintendo made in the 80s.


Since I didn't own it, I didn't have the manual to **try** and make sense of what I was playing.



What to cover:

- The very faint outline of the other sprites, who are way too dark on GBA and DS.

*Game & Watch Gallery 2* made little sense to me as a kid in the 90s. I enjoyed playing the hell out of it, but I did not understand what the game was referencing when it was talking about a Game & Watch. I just played the collection of choppy games and initially wondered what the deal was with the classic and modern distinction. I could piece together that the modern games were advanced reimagining of the old games, with more involved gameplay, but I finally understood what a Game & Watch was once I had played the game long enough. Not that I understood by playing the games. I understood because of the museum section you unlock by playing well. *Game & Watch Gallery 2* unlocks the explanation of its existence with your scores! You unlock viewable demonstrations of the games, with their release dates and a short description of the game. When enough of them were unlocked, I understood that I was playing older, much older video games brought to Game Boy. I finally recognized the gameplay for what it was: it was the gameplay of a Tiger Electronics game.

What a fun thing.

My cousin had the second game and would lend it to me so I would unlock stuff for him. He did the same thing with Zelda DX.
