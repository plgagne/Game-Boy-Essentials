I adore *Game & Watch Gallery 2*. I have fond memories of playing it extensively during the summers of 1999 and 2000. My cousins owned the game and would lend it to me during those long summer days in our respective camping trailers. I played the hell out of the game, maxing out the star count on many of the games. It's a banger of a Game Boy title. Repetitive nowadays, sure, but it was perfect for short bursts of play during boring summer days. I heartily recommend you play it, even if you think its selection of Game & Watch titles is subpar at first glance. You'd be wrong; it's essential.

## Confused

I've talked before about my puzzlement at Game & Watch devices when I was kid. I had no idea what the name meant, since I had never seen a Game & Watch. I was a bit too young, and from a remote region where nothing cool ever reached us. In my mind, *Game & Watch Gallery 2* was a minigame collection. I could not figure out why each game had a classic mode that used extremely simple graphics with zero animation. Why was the movement so choppy in the classic mode? I could piece together that the modern games were advanced reimagining of the old games, with more involved gameplay. Only after improving my English and reading the messages from the hints section did I figure out that Game & Watch  was a series of single game systems that Nintendo made in the 80s. *Game & Watch Gallery 2* unlocks the explanation of its existence with your scores! You unlock viewable demonstrations of the games, with their release dates and a short description of the game. When enough of them were unlocked, I understood that I was playing older video games from before the Game Boy's release.

## Staggered Release

Let's do a little sidebar and talk about the arrested release of the game. Initially released in Japan in September 1997 as Game Boy Gallery 2, that release is a grey cart with Super Game Boy support, as was the style at the time. The Game Boy was reinvigorated by the release of Pokémon in Japan in 1996, allowing Nintendo to produce such a slavish homage to Game & Watch in 1997.

However, they waited for the 1998 release of Pokémon in the West to bring the game to our shores. The Color was out by then and Nintendo took the time to have the game properly colourized for it. So those Western releases are all black carts. As was the style at the time. Had they released the game in 1997 as a grey cart before Pokémon, no one here would have cared and it wouldn't have sold. Such is the power of Pokémon; it resurrects consoles from financial death.



What to cover:

- The very faint outline of the other sprites, who are way too dark on GBA and DS.

What a fun thing.

My cousin had the second game and would lend it to me so I would unlock stuff for him. He did the same thing with Zelda DX.
