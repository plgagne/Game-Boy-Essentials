# Great Greed

*Great Greed* is not a particularly interesting game. It's an unremarkable RPG in every sense. Knowing this, I can state for a fact that my wife is the person that has enjoyed *Great Greed* the most. No one has gotten more pleasure out of *Great Greed* than her, and she has never played it. This makes this game essential.

How can my wife, without having played *Great Greed*, even qualify for such a strange achievement? You have to start by knowing that my wife and I love shitty movies that are so bad they're good. Those movies made by people who didn't know any better. Movies like a train wreck that captures your attention with their horror. We both love seminal classic *The Room*, I enjoy *Neil Breen* very much and I am a unrepetent fan of *THE* (hack frauds)[].

I have never laughed more at a video game than playing *Great Greed*. I don't believe anyone else could come close to enj

You feel like It breaks the barrier of reality. Itâ€™s hard to understand what it does to your mind. It is the funniest game I have played in my life. Out of pure coincidence, my wife was watching me play the game and we both could not stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the game.

There is no *canonical big Japanese RPG* on Game Boy. On SNES you have Final Fantasy IV, on NES you have Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior, on Sega systems you had Phatasy Star.

Big games with meaty stories, long playtime and relatively tame design systems. All RPGs on Game Boy have something incredibly weird about them. Great Greed fits right into this grand tradition.
