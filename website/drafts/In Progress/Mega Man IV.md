# Mega Man IV

MINAKUCHI ENGINEERING DEVELOPED MEGA MAN X3!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've thought about Rockman a bit more. He's simply Astro Boy. Games start with sorrow. He's just a little boy robot who wants to be left alone. Then the call to action and suddenly you're on. In Mega Man 2 on Nes the call to action is you literally pressing start. He puts on his helmet and off he goes to fight the evil Dr. Wily. It's a perfect video game premise. The Game Boy games have none of that simple premise.

Compared to 4, 2 feels like a collection of tileset mushed together.

Them slowdowns. They're there to help though.

Played it figured it was going to be easy with all the stuff given to you but no, you mostly die from the pits. Bit of a shame. Hard in a kind of unfair way.

It's a polished gem. All the edges have been sanded-off to give you a clean, complex, difficult and rewarding experience. They got it right on the fourth try !

The last segment of the game, after all 8 robot masters, is as is tradition, lacking in saves. Which is a shame for a Game Boy title, considering it is very lax with its continues, putting you right on top of the action.

Note on price. Do not pay those atrocious US prices.
