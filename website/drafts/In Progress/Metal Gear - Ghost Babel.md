Upon its release outside Japan, the Game Boy Color title discussed here was called *Metal Gear Solid*. That being **also** the name of the 1998 Playstation game, it would be unwieldy to constantly have to explain which game I'm talking about. For this reason, I will refer to the Game Boy Color title by its japanese name instead: *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. It's a nice name and a reference to the Game Boy. *MG: **GB***. Get it?

- the AI
- the anti-piracy elevator? Or was it a bug? It got me to buy the game!
- the game is of its era. it has a ton of difficult puzzles that did not age well. the door one, the boxes factory.
- the story was a big element upon release. it had a full character arc for Snake. He starts the game willingly isolated, and strives to act upon the end of the game. (I need to check that?)
- it works by chapters. probably helped a lot with development to split it like that.
- i was mesmerized by the game upon its release. i loved everything it did.
- the music. it's great.
- it got me interested in stealth games, and got me to buy the game that truly charmed me; *Thief 2: The Metal Age*.
- The game was developed by Tose. But all its developers seem to be fully credited on Mobygames (are they credited in the game) compared to a game like [Dragon Warrior III](https://www.mobygames.com/game/138514/dragon-warrior-iii/credits/gameboy-color/)
- The game was directed by [Shinta Nojiri](https://www.mobygames.com/person/57923/shinta-nojiri/) who went on to also direct the first Metal Gear Acid.
- They really did a chameleon thing of becoming a great developer. Jeremy Parsih talked about their work in an episode of GBworld
- It's exciting to play and in my humble opinion more accomplished in terms of gameplay and situations than the Playstation game. It has the benefit of being made after it.
- Fuck the boxes factory.
- There is a hidden wreckage of the first Metal Gear robot-thingie [hidden in the last level](https://archive.org/details/metal-gear-solid-ghost-babel-perfect-guide/page/n79/mode/2up).

I've spent my whole formative years watching the dissapointing sequels to classic movies. I've seen *Ghostbusters 2* before the first one. *Alien 3* was my first alien movie. Same thing for *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*. *Robocop 2* was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit. My first *Superman* was *Superman IV*. *City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold* was my first Billy Crystal movie. When I was 15, my parents dropped me off at the cinema to see *Hannibal*, even though I had never seen *Silence of the Lambs*. *Bill and Ted 2* was my only time with William S. Preston Esq. and Ted "Theodore" Logan until I saw the first one in 2020. That sequel is far from disappointing, I actually prefer it. I loved the craziness of *Gremlins 2* before I ever saw the original. On a slightly related note, like most of my friends I saw *Spaceballs* before I saw any *Star Wars* movie. I have to say the transformation of *Spaceball One* into *Mega Maid* was more surprising than any special effects in the first three *Star Wars*.

Which brings us to *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. Back in the late 90s I did not have a Playstation but still wanted to play *Metal Gear Solid*. I was supremely interested; there was this video game that was supposedly as good as a movie! When Konami announced an upcoming *Metal Gear* game for Game Boy Color, I was immediately interested. Initial images were very promising.

The people at Konami were not proposing strange gameplay mechanics that had very little to do with *Metal Gear Solid*. Many franchises coming to Game Boy would severely change their gameplay to fit the confines of the small console. *Ultima*, *Turok*, *Resident Evil*, *Perfect Dark*. Those are all franchises that drastically changed the gameplay for which they were known when they came to Game Boy. The *Metal Gear* franchise would later do the same thing with [Metal Gear Acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Acid). But here they were making a legitimate *Metal Gear* title. It even had a story told through cutscenes and CODEC conversations and everything! Of course with hindsight I now know that the team at Konami was pulling the same trick a second time. The trick was basing everything on their older MSX2 titles but for a new context. They brought the gameplay of the MSX2 to a 3D game on Playstation and now they would once again bring the gameplay of the MSX2 but this time to the Game Boy Color.

I bought it, and thus my first experience with Solid Snake was the Game Boy game. I later played *Metal Gear Solid* when I bought a copy of its PC port. Before I talk about the Game Boy Color game, I have to share my views on *Metal Gear Solid*, which are very simple; it's great, but greatly flawed. For example, its story is simple yet full of ridiculously awesome twists and turns. When Miller removes his glasses, the animation is so well done and really punctuates the enormity of the reveal. Compared to that, when a cutscene uses the 3D graphics of the gameplay the only thing the character can do are bob their heads up and down. That's a great flaw of the game; not only do the characters feature no facial animation, their heads are nearly featureless. The texture stretched across their polygonal faces use faint colours for mouths and eyes, which blends them within the void of their faces. So the game will have these long solliloquies where you're looking at Liquid Snake's blank face bobbing up and down. Many earlier Playstation or N64 titles had rudimentary facial animations; *Metal Gear Solid* was backwards in that regard. Under the column of great but greatly flawed, you can also count the gameplay. It's enemy AI is stupid sure, but it is properly defined. The soldiers will react stupidly but will not do frustrating things. However, the game has no persistence. Outside of lowering your hidden score being discovered has zero long term impact. You find a hiding spot to let the timer run out and the whole universe assumes you were never previously spotted with all the enemies you killed respawning. I played *Metal Gear Solid* well after *Thief 2*, where guards can become permanently stuck as paranoid motherfuckers looking for you in every dark corner, weapons at the ready while shouting at the top of their lungs that there's a thief somewhere. Since *MGS* does not have any of that glorious persistence, I was unimpressed with the very on/off state of enemy soldiers. Of course this is explained by the limits of the PlayStation but also by the nature of *MGS*. In terms of gameplay the game is very much a 3D version of the 1990 MSX2 game. Not much in terms of gameplay is differwent between the two (except for that whole 3D thing). So the very severe limits of that game were brought forward to *Metal Gear Solid*. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. Proof in point, the limits of the MSX2 were brought, just the same, to Game Boy Color. And it worked magnificiently!

Looking through the history of *MGS*, you can kind of understand
