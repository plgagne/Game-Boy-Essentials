# Metal Gear: Ghost Babel
- the AI
- the anti-piracy elevator? Or was it a bug? It got me to buy the game!
- the game is of its era. it has a ton of difficult puzzles that did not age well. the door one, the boxes factory.
- the story was a big element upon release. it had a full character arc for Snake. He starts the game willingly isolated, and strives to act upon the end of the game. (I need to check that?)
- it works by chapters. probably helped a lot with development to split it like that.
- i was mesmerized by the game upon its release. i loved everything it did.

I've spent my whole formative years watching the dissapointing sequels to classic movies. I've seen *Ghostbusters 2* before the first one. *Alien 3* was my first alien movie. Same thing for *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*. *Robocop 2* was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit. My first *Superman* was *Superman IV*. *City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold* was my first Billy Crystal movie. When I was 15, my parents dropped me off at the cinema to see *Hannibal*, without having previously seen *Silence of the Lambs*. I saw *Terminator 2: Judgement Day* first, but I think that's the case for a lot of people and that movie is not disappointing. *Bill and Ted 2* was the only movie featuring William S. Preston Esq. and Ted "Theodore" Logan as far as I was concerned until I saw the first one in 2020. Once again, that sequel is far from disappointing, I actually prefer it. I loved the craziness of *Gremlins 2* before I ever saw the original. Finally, like most of my friends I saw *Spaceballs* before I saw any *Star Wars* movie. I have to say the transformation of *Spaceball One* into *Mega Maid* is more impressive than any special effects in *Star Wars*.

Which brings us to *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. Back in the late 90s I did not have a Playstation and I wanted to play *Metal Gear Solid*. When Konami announced a *Metal Gear* game for Game Boy Color, I was immediately interested.

The game was secretly developed by Tose.

They really did a chameleon thing of becoming a great developer. Jeremy Parsih talked about their work in an episode of GBworld

It's exciting to play and in my humble opinion more accomplished in terms of gameplay and situations than the Playstation game.

Fuck the boxes factory.
