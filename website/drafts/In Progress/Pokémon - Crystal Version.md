# Pokémon Crystal Version

Pokémon is like the Game Boy itself; it is backward compatible with the previous generation.

You have this story of chose président heroically coming in to make a compression system for the game allowing making them suddenly realize to put in Kanto. I don't buy it. He was a fixer, sent in to rescue troubled projects. I think they were on path for the game to be shorter then the original and he came in and helped them build a compression system so they could make it as big as they wanted.

I truly believe the game is awesome but there are so many different ways to approach a sequel; no backward compat with a new engine maybe could have been great.
