Sometimes, when I end up in a hazy stupor, I decide I'm going to play some random Star Trek game on Game Boy and review it. Once again I'm looking at a game that no one has looked at because it has a generic name and is based on a version on another system. In this case, what I've heard is that it's exactly the same as the NES version. To vary things up, let's compare and contrast.

I sometimes can accelerate, but sometimes not. I need to figure out the controls before I move forward.
Let me just read the manual ... wait what no one has scanned the manual ?
I find out that the game is a port of the NES version and is exactly the same.
That's an extremely lucky coincidence.
I find the NES manual on Internet Archive.
I figure out that you steer in steer mode and accelerate in crew selection mode.
Ouf, that's shitty.
At this point I need a break.
