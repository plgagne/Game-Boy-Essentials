# Super Mario Bros. Deluxe

## Crisp gameplay since 1985

I used to hate Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Now I've grown to appreciate it a lot. Here's why.

## Context

*Super Mario Bros. Deluxe* truly put the pedal to the metal with the Game Boy Color. Before it came out, the Game Boy Color had been out for six months but the games that came out for it were all half-measures. They were black cartridges, games that could also be played on a regular Game Boy without any major differences. Those games were all testing the water of the Game Boy Color. They stuck to the tricks they knew to make a Game Boy title easy to see on an original grey DMG and then added a colour palette if you happened to play it on a Game Boy Color. On top of that, by their nature of being backwards-compatible titles, they could not get access the 8.388 MHz speed of the Game Boy Color; they were stuck at 4.194 MHz and could not use the extra RAM of the Game Boy Color.

It's interesting to note how every video game player seemed to have been clamoring for a colored Game Boy since the first one came out in 1989 but once it finally arrived eight long years later developers were very slow to adopt it full-scale. This is greatly explained by the backwards compatibility. You don't want to suddenly abandon the largest console market that has ever existed because a new uncertain Game Boy is out. So you make backwards-compatible black cartridges to cover all your bases. Even Nintendo did this: *Tetris DX*, that came out the day the Game Boy Color arrived and is arguably the standard-bearer of the new console is a black cartridge. But Nintendo knew they had to blaze the trail. It's under this context that they made *Super Mario Bros. Deluxe*. It is not a backwards-compatible game; only a Game Boy Color can play this extremely faithful port of the classic Famicom/NES game.

## Love

I've read somewhere that they've tightened the controls so I wanted to see for myself.

They added a bunch of little sounds to help you figure out what's happening around you that you can't see.

## Hate

An excellent example of the game's design as a portable Super Mario for people who had played it before are the Hammer Bros. They are arguably the hardest thing in the game because you have to work hard to manage your position in relation to theirs and wait for an opening but because the screen is so small you can't adequately do it. They are most difficult when accompanied by their twin platforms and when the screen is in its normal position, you cannot see if any Hammer Bros. is on the topmost platform. How are you supposed to manage how to make your way through their dual barrage of hammers to hit one of them on the head or hit him from under a platform if you can't see both at the same time? I'll tell you how: practice. If you've played this game obsessively when you had an NES you instinctively know where they are exactly just by looking at where their hammers are. Otherwise you won't be able to develop a strategy for dealing with them efficiently with this game.
