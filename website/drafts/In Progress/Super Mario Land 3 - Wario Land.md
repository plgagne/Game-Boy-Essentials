## Controls and sprites

Wario is a big boy

## Playing the Game

*Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3* is much more fun than *Super Mario Land 2*. It's a much longer game, with

can carry items across screens. level memory is kept after one screen.

Making money appear in your hand is a complete mistake. Why is it needed when contextual level elements could be used instead?

## Conclusion

Nintendo usually releases one new title per franchise per console. They've been doing it since their earliest days, and they have rarely strayed from this formula. One new *Animal Crossing* game per console, one new *Legend of Zelda* game per console. Before the release of the Super Nintendo, however, the company had made sequels to their most iconic series: Super Mario had multiple Famicom titles. Altough the lineage gets complicated with the second game, *Super Mario Bros. 3* elevated the concepts of the previous titles while still being on the same hardware.

SO the two pseudo sequels here are kind of some sense of a transition perhaps?

A perplexing thing happened. We had two Mario games in a row. 1989's *Super Mario Land* and 1992's *Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins*. Some time passed and now it's 1994. You go to your local store, eager to see new Game Boy titles, and you come upon a thing called *Wario Land*? Underneath that title is written *Super Mario Land 3*. Suddenly Mario is no longer the star of his own games. SYou remember Wario, he was in the advertising for the previous game, but why is the villain from the last Game Boy adventure a hero now? He's fat, he's slow, he smells, he doesn't jump very high. Yet he's front and centre in this new adventure, and the game is genuinely awesome! How could such a slovenely idiot take over for the world's most famous plumber? What happened?

To answer those questions, we have to dig into Nintendo's internal politics. We might have this reflex to think that Nintendo is this monolith that does everything with a single mind, led by the genius Shigeru Miyamoto, but the truth is far from that. Very far from that. In the early 90s, Nintendo was divided into different independent divisions shaped in the image of their managers. They've been compared to Daimyo, landlords of feudal Japan, and the comparison is apt. The division managers had to fulfill the missions given to them by Nintendo's leader, Hiroshi Ymauchi, but they had a lot of leeway on how to achieve these missions. Just like the Daimyo and the Shogun.

Research & Development 1: The first division, given to Gunpei Yokoi in 1970 to give him free rein to develop new toys and ideas. It eventually turned into a company within the company, responsible for games, arcades, toys and portable console development.
Research & Development 2: Headed by Masayuki Uemura, who was given a division in 1972 shortly after leaving Sharp for Nintendo. It made very few games, limiting itself to a handful of ports. At first it supported R&D1 with electronic support, but later single-handedly created the hardware of the Famicom and Super Famicom.
Research & Development 3: The smallest division, headed by Genyo Takeda starting in 1974. It reflected Takeda's reputation as a fixer by making the things Nintendo needed, be it games specifically made for the Western market or bespoke MMC chips to improve the limited capabilities of the Famicom.
Research & Development 4: The youngest division, created as a reward in 1983 to Shigeru Miyamoto for his early arcade successes with *Donkey Kong* and *Mario Bros.*. Fully focused on video games, it was renamed Nintendo EAD (Entertainment Analysis & Development) in 1989.

The whole division system at Nintendo stopped in 2002, with an internal reorganziation along software and hardware development. Wario's birth is rooted in this divisional system: Wario was created inside R&D1 managed by Gunpei Yokoi, not at EAD managed by Shigeru Miyamoto. R&D1 made all the Mario Land games for Game Boy, but Mario was Miyamoto's creation. So there was a kind of internal licensing of Mario from the EAD team. This might sound strange, so let me explain. Nintendo's developers have made sure to ask permission from a creator before using their characters if the creator is not directly involved in the project. Let's take Mario's appearance in *NES Open Tournament Golf*. Ueamura, who was making the game in R&D2, asked Miyamoto's permission to use Mario in the golf game. Nothing formal, no money was exchanged hands; it was just expected to always ask permission.

R&D1 thus asked Miyamoto to use Mario for the first two *Mario Land* games. Actually, they asked because Hiroshi Yamauchi, the ruthless leader of Nintendo, forced them to ask. Yamauchi wanted Mario games on Game Boy. The R&D2 developers later explained they felt constrained because they had to make games that felt like a Mario game. Meaning that Miyamoto probably asked them to make a game that felt like a Mario platformer. Nothing was written anywhere, it was probably just Miyamoto having a small verbal caveat when agreeing. It's all very japanese. By the time they were thinking of making a third Mario Land game, however, a little thing had changed; Miyamoto was now making Game Boy games.

At this point what I am saying is conjecture. While the developers of *Wario Land* have publicly said they felt constrained using Mario and chose to use their own character instead, I think the real reason is Miyamoto no longer wanted others to use Mario on Game Boy. Miyamoto was hard at work making a very expansive Game Boy platformer starring the plumber himself. It would release a mere four months after *Wario Land* in June 1994, the inadequately named *Donkey Kong*.

I fully believe Miyamoto gave impossible constraints to the R&D1 staff to use Mario in a third Mario Land game, making it clear to them that Mario was no longer available to them. Faced with this issue, they instead used their own creation, Wario, for their next platformer. Constraints lead to greater creativity, and an essential game.

## The ... Story?

In his first video game appearance in *Super Mario Land 2*, Wario had taken over Mario’s private island. This private abode for the world's most succesful video game character has a giant statue of him, a private hippopotamus launchpad to the moon, his very own haunted house, and a gigantic palatial castle all for the glory of the famous plumber. The young developpers of R&D1, including Wario's creator Hiroji Kiyotake, were egging on Mario's success. Mario is so sucessful he's got a castle and an enormous statue dedicated to himself. In a sense, they were egging on Miyamoto himself. I mean, Miyamoto had a whole division within Nintendo, with a ton of budget and staff, all dedicated to supporting him. I read the exaggerated reverence to Mario in *Mario Land 2* as a playful jab at Miyamoto the superstar.

In that previous game, Wario's role is like Bluto from the classic Popeye cartoons; Kiyotake, the creator of Wario, has said so himself. He's an evil version of Mario jealous of his success so he stole his private island. Since everybody enjoyed Wario's farcical take on Mario, it became clear they could elevate him to protagonist. Changing their protagonist could give them new exciting gameplay opportunities. They were now making a Wario game, so they could make their own choices; they no longer had to respect the Mario gameplay traditions. They could even make fun of them now. That's why Wario loves garlic. Mario eats mushrooms, so Wario eats another vegetable-adjacent thing.

They also chose to adorn Wario with a varied collection of hard hats in this game. The whole upgrade system is based on collecting three different hats with different abilities, and the game starts with an explanation for why Wario is wearing hard hats in this game instead of his cap.

The story couldn't be simpler. Here it is straight from the manual:

> Remember *Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins*? Wario tried to take over Mario’s castle, but didn’t have much luck. Wario, being the persistent guy he is, has not given up. Now, he wants a castle more than ever before.
>
> One day, Wario was practising being mean when he thought to himself, “Rumour has it that the pirates of Kitchen Island have stolen the giant golden statue of Princess Toadstool. Mario is looking for it but, if I find it first, I could cash it in for a princess’ ransom. With that cash and the pirates’ other treasures and coins, I could buy a palace that is way bigger than Mario’s pathetic excuse for a castle. Ga, ha, ha, ha...! What am I waiting for!?”
>
> Full of confidence, Wario took off. He didn’t even stop to think of how tough the Brown Sugar Pirates were. Their leader, Captain Syrup was known the world over for being a really rotten and ruthless guy.
>
> Can Wario find the coins and treasures hidden on Kitchen Island? What will his new palace look like? Will he keep being so mean and ugly?
Let’s find out!
