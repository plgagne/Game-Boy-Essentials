# True Lies
It's February of 1995, and a lot of video game industry people are expecting the Game Boy to wrap up and Nintendo to move on to something else. Of course, with hindsight we know that it's not what happened at all, but people had no way of knowing back then. You can't fault them, all the signs point to the nearing end of the Game Boy. Hardware sales have had their biggest year in 1993, and the amount of released games has slowed. Look at these charts, and you can see that 1995 is the nadir of Game Boy sales.

What's left are mostly licensed titles.

Why are old licensed games based on movies terrible? Those games have to hit a release, no matter what, so it certainly doesn't help. They were also, by virtue of being based on something new, expensive to license. A license like The Terminator must have been expensive to obtain. Those are some of the things that hinder a project even before its begun. But then we come to Game Boy, and *True Lies*. It's a competent game. Nothing extraordinary, but it's actually ok. How come?
