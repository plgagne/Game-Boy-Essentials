A perplexing thing happened after the release of *Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins*. You go to your local store in 1994, eager to see new Game Boy titles, and you come upon a thing called *Wario Land*? Underneath that title is written *Super Mario Land 3*. Suddenly Mario is no longer the star of his own games. You kind of remember Wario since he was in the advertising for the previous game, but why is the villain from the last Game Boy adventure a hero now? He's fat, he's slow, he smells, he doesn't jump very high. Yet he's front and centre in this new adventure, and everybody agrees the game is genuinely awesome! How could such a slovenely idiot take over for the world's most famous plumber? What happened?

To answer this question, we have to dig into Nintendo's internal politics. We might have this reflex to think that Nintendo is this monolith that does everything led by the genius Shigeru Miyamoto, but the truth is far from that. Very far from that. In the early 90s, Nintendo was divided into different independent divisions shaped in the image of their managers. Those managers have been compared to the Daimyo, the landlords of feudal Japan answerable only to the Shogun, and the comparison is apt. The division managers had to fulfill the missions given to them by Nintendo's leader, Hiroshi Ymauchi, but they had a lot of leeway on how to achieve these missions. Just like the Daimyo and the Shogun.

Let's list the divisions, it's going to be easier for us to understand what's happening with *Wario Land*.

Research & Development 1: The first division, given to Gunpei Yokoi in 1970 to freely develop new toys and ideas. It eventually turned into a company within the company, responsible for games, arcades, toys, and portable console development.
Research & Development 2: Headed by Masayuki Uemura, who was given a division in 1972 shortly after leaving Sharp for Nintendo. At first it supported R&D1 with the electronics in their projects, but later single-handedly created the hardware of the Famicom and Super Famicom. It made very few games, limiting itself to a handful of ports.
Research & Development 3: The smallest division, headed by Genyo Takeda starting in 1974. It reflected Takeda's reputation as a fixer by making the things Nintendo needed at the moment, be it games specifically made for the Western market or bespoke MMC chips to improve the limited capabilities of the Famicom.
Research & Development 4: The youngest division, created as a reward in 1983 to Shigeru Miyamoto for his early arcade successes with *Donkey Kong* and *Mario Bros.*. Fully focused on video games, it was renamed Nintendo EAD (Entertainment Analysis & Development) in 1989.

The whole division system at Nintendo stopped in 2002, with an internal reorganziation along software and hardware development. Wario's birth is rooted in the divisional system: Wario was created inside R&D1 managed by Gunpei Yokoi, not at EAD managed by Shigeru Miyamoto. R&D1 made all the Mario Land games for Game Boy but Mario was Miyamoto's creation. So there was a kind of internal licensing of Mario from the EAD team. This sounds strange so let me explain. Nintendo's developers have always made sure to ask permission from a creator before using their characters if the creator is not directly involved in the project. Let's take Mario's appearance in *NES Open Tournament Golf*. Ueamura, who was making the game at R&D2, asked Miyamoto's permission to use Mario in the golf game. Nothing formal, no money was exchanged hands; it was just expected to always ask permission.

R&D1 thus asked Miyamoto to use Mario for the first two *Mario Land* games. Actually, they asked because Hiroshi Yamauchi, the ruthless leader of Nintendo, forced them to ask. Yamauchi wanted Mario games on Game Boy. The R&D2 developers later explained they felt constrained because they had to make games that felt like a Mario game. Meaning that Miyamoto probably expected them to make a game that felt like a Mario platformer. Nothing was written anywhere, it was probably just Miyamoto having a small verbal caveat when agreeing. It's all very japanese. By the time they were thinking of making a third Mario Land game, however, a little thing had changed; Miyamoto was now making his own Game Boy games.

At this point what I am saying is conjecture. While the developers of *Wario Land* have publicly said they felt constrained using Mario and chose to use their own character instead, I think the real reason is Miyamoto no longer wanted others to use Mario on Game Boy. Miyamoto was hard at work making his own very expansive Game Boy platformer starring the plumber himself. It would release a mere four months after *Wario Land* in June 1994, the inadequately named *Donkey Kong*.

I fully believe Miyamoto gave impossible constraints to the R&D1 staff to use Mario in a third Mario Land game, making it clear to them that Mario was no longer available to them. Faced with this issue, they instead used their own creation, Wario, for their next platformer. Constraints lead to greater creativity, and an essential game.

## The ... Story?

In his first video game appearance in *Super Mario Land 2*, Wario had taken over Mario’s private island. This private abode for the world's most succesful video game character has a giant statue of him, a private hippopotamus launchpad to the moon, his very own haunted house, and a gigantic palatial castle all for the glory of the famous plumber. The young developpers of R&D1, including Wario's creator Hiroji Kiyotake, were egging on Mario's success. Mario is so sucessful he's got a castle and an enormous statue dedicated to himself. In a sense, they were egging on Miyamoto himself. I mean, Miyamoto had a whole division within Nintendo, with a ton of budget and staff, all dedicated to supporting him. I read the exaggerated reverence to Mario in *Mario Land 2* as a playful jab at Miyamoto the superstar.

In that previous game Wario's role is like Bluto from the classic Popeye cartoons; Kiyotake, the creator of Wario has said so himself. He's an evil version of Mario jealous of his success so he stole his private island, just like Bluto would kidnap Olive Oil or the baby with two names. Since everybody enjoyed Wario's farcical take on Mario it became clear they could elevate him to protagonist. Changing their protagonist could give them new exciting gameplay opportunities. They were now making a Wario game so they could make their own choices; they no longer had to respect the Mario gameplay traditions. They could even make fun of them now. That's why Wario loves garlic. Mario eats mushrooms, so Wario eats another vegetable-adjacent thing.

They also chose to adorn Wario with a varied collection of hard hats in this game as a take on the special abilities Mario can use. The whole upgrade system is based on collecting three different hats with different capabilities, and the game starts with an explanation for why Wario is wearing hard hats in this game instead of his cap.

{% include figure.html type="gb" class="gallery" filename="intro-d" figcaption="He picks it up, gives a thumbs up, and the game can begin." %}
</div>

The story couldn't be simpler. Here it is straight from the manual:

> Remember *Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins*? Wario tried to take over Mario’s castle, but didn’t have much luck. Wario, being the persistent guy he is, has not given up. Now, he wants a castle more than ever before.
>
> One day, Wario was practising being mean when he thought to himself, “Rumour has it that the pirates of Kitchen Island have stolen the giant golden statue of Princess Toadstool. Mario is looking for it but, if I find it first, I could cash it in for a princess’ ransom. With that cash and the pirates’ other treasures and coins, I could buy a palace that is way bigger than Mario’s pathetic excuse for a castle. Ga, ha, ha, ha...! What am I waiting for!?”
>
> Full of confidence, Wario took off. He didn’t even stop to think of how tough the Brown Sugar Pirates were. Their leader, Captain Syrup was known the world over for being a really rotten and ruthless guy.
>
> Can Wario find the coins and treasures hidden on Kitchen Island? What will his new palace look like? Will he keep being so mean and ugly?
Let’s find out!

## The Vibes are Good, Even Though Wario Is A Big Boy

I have talked again and again about the challenges developers had in making games fit within the minuscule 160 by 144 pixels resolution of the Game Boy. Developers had a hard time adapting to the smaller real estate at first, but we have a game here from the fifth year of the Game Boy's life from the same division who created the Game Boy. They knew that the secret to a good action game on Game Boy lied in an adapted level design. So they really indulged themselves, and made Wario enormous on the screen.

## Playing the Game

*Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3* is much more fun than *Super Mario Land 2*. It's a much longer game, with

can carry items across screens. level memory is kept after one screen.

Making money appear in your hand is a complete mistake. Why is it needed when contextual level elements could be used instead?
