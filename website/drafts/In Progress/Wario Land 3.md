There's this pervasive narrative that Nintendo didn't make any Mario platformer between *Mario Land 2* and *New Super Mario Bros.*. That's hogwash. Between this supposed gap, Nintendo released its two best and most innovative platformers. *Yoshi's Island*, Shigeru Miyamoto's masterpiece was released in 1995 and was very much a Mario game. What happened afterwards turned the subsequent Yoshi games into a different thing. An easier, kid-friendly set of games. This first one is not to be confused for an easier game for younger players. It is the next platforming game from Miyamoto after *Super Mario World*.

In 2000, the crew at R&D1 released their own masterpiece: *Wario Land 3*. Let's explore in detail why it's up there as a great game.


## Conclusion
To me there's a trifecta of platforming perfection. *Yoshi's Island*, *Donkey Kong Country 2* and *Wario Land 3*.
