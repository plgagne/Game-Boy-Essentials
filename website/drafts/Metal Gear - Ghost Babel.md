I've spent my whole formative years watching the sequels to 80s movies without having seen the first ont. I've seen *Ghostbusters 2* before the first one. *Alien 3* was my first Alien movie. Same thing for *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*, altough that's arguably the best one. *Robocop 2* was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit. My first *Superman* was *Superman IV*. *City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold* was my first Billy Crystal movie. I only ever saw *Coccoon: The Return*, never the original. *Bill and Ted 2* was the only one of the two I'd seen until I saw the first one much later. I loved the craziness and meta references of *Gremlins 2* before I ever saw the original. Finally, like most of my friends I saw *Spaceballs* before I saw any *Star Wars* movie. I have to admit that the transformation of *Spaceball One* into *Mega Maid* was more impressive to me than any special effects in the first three *Star Wars*.

Which brings us to *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I played the Game Boy Color game before I ever touched the PlayStation classic. Once again I enjoyed the follow-up first.

Before we move on, we need to clarify nomenclature. Upon its release outside Japan, the Game Boy Color title discussed here was called *Metal Gear Solid*. That being **also** the name of the 1998 Playstation game, it would be unwieldy to constantly have to explain which of the two games I'm talking about. For this reason, I will refer to the Game Boy Color title by its original japanese name instead: *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. It's a nice name and a reference to the Game Boy. *MG: **GB***. Get it?

Back in the late 90s I did not have a Playstation but still wanted to play *Metal Gear Solid*. I was supremely interested; there was this video game that was supposedly as good as a movie! Of course, I had no idea back then that this was all marketing. *Metal Gear Solid* pretends it's like a movie but it is nothing like the serious films it tries to replicate. Hideo Kojima desperetaly wants to make games that are structured like the best american thrillers, but he still writes as if its a disposable anime for edgy teenagers.

When Konami announced they were making a *Metal Gear* game for Game Boy Color, I was immediately interested. Initial images were very promising:

The people at Konami were not proposing strange gameplay mechanics that had very little to do with *Metal Gear Solid*. Many franchises coming to Game Boy would severely change their gameplay to fit the confines of the small console. *Ultima*, *Turok*, *Resident Evil*, *Perfect Dark*. Those are all franchises that drastically changed the gameplay for which they were known when they came to Game Boy. But here they were making a legitimate *Metal Gear* title. It even had a story told through cutscenes and CODEC conversations and everything! Of course in hindsight I now know that the team at Konami, like a bad magician, were just repackaging the same old trick they had already done once before.

The magic trick was very simple: bring the gameplay of their 1990 MSX2 game *Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake* to another platform. That's what they had done with the Playstation game *Metal Gear Solid*. Now they would once again bring the gameplay of the MSX2 but this time to Game Boy Color. To help explain what I mean and make sure you understand the convoluted early history of Metal Gear, I made a chart!

I have to remind you I pirated the game initially. In 2000, GBC emulators were good enough to play the new releases as soon as someone dumped the ROM online. There were some games that did not work properly back then, which I talked about in my [*Toy Story Racer* article](/articles/cgb-bt5e). I even already told the story of my exprience with *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. Let me tell it again. The first elevator of the game, encountered on the fourth mission, failed to move me to the next section of the facility. The second I pressed the elevator's button, I was stuck in there forever. I do not know if it was a bug or a voluntary anti-piracy measure. It would [appear that the game indeed has code to lock up emulators on the title screen](https://new.tcrf.net/Metal_Gear_Solid_(Game_Boy_Color)) and I wouldn't put it past the developpers at Konami to include piracy counter-measures later in the game. I'm not competent enough to test my theory, but keep in mind dear reader that modern emulators are now indistinguishable to real hardware. No anti-piracy code gets triggered anymore.

It was very frustrating to hit a wall like that, especially since I played through the game three times to verify I was really stuck: twice on the same emulator and a third time with a second one that also softlocked. Even though I was getting tired of repeating the early parts of the story, I still bought the game. I had to, I was hooked. Its as if I had played a demo of the game, and was now convinced to buy it. Seriously, where have demos gone? I know they're a serious pain to make for developers, but it's a great loss so few of them exist.

I have to admit I pirated the game initially. I don't hear any police sirens so I'll keep writing. In 2000, GBC emulators had enough functionnality to allow you to play all the new releases the second someone dumped the ROM online. More importantly for me, they were able to run on crappy PCs of the time. There were some games that did not work properly back then, which I talked about in my [*Toy Story Racer* article](/articles/cgb-bt5e). I even already told the story of my exprience with *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel* in that article. Let me tell it again. The first elevator of the game, encountered on the fourth mission, failed to move me to the next section of the facility. The second I pressed the elevator's button, I was stuck in there forever. I do not know if it was a bug or a voluntary anti-piracy measure.

It's a common way to hide anti-piracy code.

Even though I was getting tired of repeating the early parts of the story, I caved and just bought the game. I had to, I was hooked. Its as if I had played a demo of the game, and was now convinced to buy it.

## The Flaws

## The Qualities

I had intended to write this intense deep dive into the game, but a five-minute online search led me to find this wonderful [2022 retrospective on the game from Renan Fontes on Goomba Stomp](https://goombastomp.com/metal-gear-ghost-babel-game-boy-color-retrospective/). Renan said everything in his article I wanted to say about the game! I'd definetely recommend reading his overview of the game, with Renan having extensive comparisons with the two MSX games, which I have played only cursorily.

In his article, he gives a lot of credence to the improvements Metal Gear Solid brought to the franchise and how they're represented in this game. I mean yeah it's informed a lot by the PlayStation game, but it's a lot more like the older MSX2 game in spirit. The sprite work is echoing the style of *Metal Gear Solid*, but to my opinion the game is built on the trappings of the 1990 game, not the 1998 one.

It's a great game.

- the AI
- the game is of its era. it has a ton of difficult puzzles that did not age well. the door one, the boxes factory.
- the story was a big element upon release. it had a full character arc for Snake. He starts the game willingly isolated, and strives to act upon the end of the game. (I need to check that?)
- it works by chapters. probably helped a lot with development to split it like that.
- it also saves by chapter. Its very frustrating.
- i was mesmerized by the game upon its release. i loved everything it did.
- the music. it's great.
- it got me interested in stealth games, and got me to buy the game that truly charmed me; *Thief 2: The Metal Age*.
- The game was developed by Tose. But all its developers seem to be fully credited on Mobygames (are they credited in the game) compared to a game like [Dragon Warrior III](https://www.mobygames.com/game/138514/dragon-warrior-iii/credits/gameboy-color/)
- The game was directed by [Shinta Nojiri](https://www.mobygames.com/person/57923/shinta-nojiri/) who went on to also direct the first Metal Gear Acid.
- They really did a chameleon thing of becoming a great developer. Jeremy Parsih talked about their work in an episode of GBworld.
- It's exciting to play and in my humble opinion more accomplished in terms of gameplay and situations than the Playstation game. It has the benefit of being made after it.
- I played the Playstation game after ... on PC.

Of course in hindsight I now know that the team at Konami, like a bad magician, were just repackaging the same old trick they had already done once before. The magic trick was very simple: bring the gameplay of their 1990 MSX2 game *Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake* to another platform. That's what they already did with the Playstation game *Metal Gear Solid*. They brought the gameplay of the MSX2 to a 3D game on Playstation and now they would once again bring the gameplay of the MSX2 but this time to the Game Boy Color.

I later played *Metal Gear Solid* when I bought a copy of its PC port. *Metal Gear Solid* is great, but greatly flawed. For example, its story is simple yet full of ridiculously awesome twists and turns. When Miller removes his glasses, the animation is so well done and really punctuates the enormity of the reveal you're witnessing. Compared to that, when a cutscene uses the 3D graphics of the gameplay the only thing the characters can do are bob their heads up and down. That's disappointing; not only do the characters feature no facial animation, their heads are nearly featureless. The texture stretched across their polygonal faces use faint colours for mouths and eyes, which blends them within the void of their faces. So the game will have these long solliloquies where you're looking at Liquid Snake's blank face bobbing up and down. Many earlier Playstation or N64 titles had rudimentary facial animations; *Metal Gear Solid* was backwards in that regard. Under the column of great but greatly flawed, you can also count the gameplay. It's enemy AI is stupid, but it is properly defined. The soldiers will react stupidly but will not do frustrating things. However, the game has no persistence. Being discovered has zero long term impact, outside of lowering your secret final score. When you find a hiding spot to let the timer run out, the whole universe of the game assumes you were never previously spotted with all the enemies you killed simply respawning. No one is impressed when you compare that simple AI behaviour with the insane level of details you could experience in *Thief II: The Metal Age*. Guards in that game react very realistically if they lose track of you: they will become paranoid motherfuckers looking for you in every dark corner, weapons at the ready while shouting at the top of their lungs that there's a thief somewhere. If other guards are within earshot, they'll come to help them investigate. Yep, *Thief II: The Metal Age* has a sound detection system that includes the guards' own voice. Since *MGS* does not have any of that glorious persistence, I was unimpressed with the same on/off state of enemy soldiers I had seen in *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I thought it made sense for the puny Game Boy; to see the same AI behaviour on PlayStation was disheartening.

Of course this is explained by the limits of the PlayStation but also by the nature of *Metal Gear Solid*. In terms of gameplay the game is very much a 3D version of the 1990 MSX2 game. They added wall-hugging, mostly to allow you to peek at corners, but the gameplay is fundamentally the same. So the very severe limits of that 1990 game were brought forward to *Metal Gear Solid*. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. Proof in point, the Game Boy Color game had the same limits and there it worked magnificiently!

- Fuck the boxes factory.
- There is a hidden wreckage of the first Metal Gear robot-thingie [hidden in the last level](https://archive.org/details/metal-gear-solid-ghost-babel-perfect-guide/page/n79/mode/2up).
- Jenner dies. Don't act surprised. This is 0% surprising.

- Extraordinary article. Mine should take the Game Boy angle, otherwise I won't be as good.
