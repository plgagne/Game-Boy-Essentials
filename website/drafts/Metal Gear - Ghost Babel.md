I've spent my whole formative years watching the dissapointing sequels to classic movies. I've seen *Ghostbusters 2* before the first one. *Alien 3* was my first Alien movie. Same thing for *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*, altough that's arguably the best one. *Robocop 2* was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit. My first *Superman* was *Superman IV*. *City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold* was my first Billy Crystal movie. I only ever saw *Coccoon: The Return*, never the original. When I was 15, my mom dropped me off at the cinema to see *Hannibal*, even though I had never seen *Silence of the Lambs*. *Bill and Ted 2* was the only one of the two I'd seen until I saw the first one much later. I loved the craziness and meta references of *Gremlins 2* before I ever saw the original. Finally, like most of my friends I saw *Spaceballs* before I saw any *Star Wars* movie. I have to admit that the transformation of *Spaceball One* into *Mega Maid* was more impressive to me than any special effects in the first three *Star Wars*.

Which brings us to *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I played the Game Boy Color game before I ever touched the PlayStation classic. Once again I enjoyed the sequel first.

Before we move on, we need to clarify nomenclature. Upon its release outside Japan, the Game Boy Color title discussed here was called *Metal Gear Solid*. That being **also** the name of the 1998 Playstation game, it would be unwieldy to constantly have to explain which of the two games I'm talking about. For this reason, I will refer to the Game Boy Color title by its japanese name instead: *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. It's a nice name and a reference to the Game Boy. *MG: **GB***. Get it?

Back in the late 90s I did not have a Playstation but still wanted to play *Metal Gear Solid*. I was supremely interested; there was this video game that was supposedly as good as a movie! Of course, I had no idea back then that this was all marketing. *Metal Gear Solid* pretends it's like a movie but it is nothing like the serious films it tries to replicate. Hideo Kojima desperetaly wants to make games that are structured like the best american thrillers, but he still writes as if its a disposable anime for edgy teenagers.

When Konami announced they were making a *Metal Gear* game for Game Boy Color, I was immediately interested. Initial images were very promising.

The people at Konami were not proposing strange gameplay mechanics that had very little to do with *Metal Gear Solid*. Many franchises coming to Game Boy would severely change their gameplay to fit the confines of the small console. *Ultima*, *Turok*, *Resident Evil*, *Perfect Dark*. Those are all franchises that drastically changed the gameplay for which they were known when they came to Game Boy. But here they were making a legitimate *Metal Gear* title. It even had a story told through cutscenes and CODEC conversations and everything! Of course in hindsight I now know that the team at Konami, like a bad magician, were just repackaging the same old trick they had already done once before.

The magic trick was very simple: bring the gameplay of their 1990 MSX2 game *Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake* to another platform. That's what they already did with the Playstation game *Metal Gear Solid*. They brought the gameplay of the MSX2 to a 3D game on Playstation and now they would once again bring the gameplay of the MSX2 but this time to the Game Boy Color. To help explain what I mean and make sure you understand the convoluted early history of Metal Gear, I made a chart!

I have to remind you I pirated the game initially. In 2000, GBC emulators had enough functionnality to allow you to play all the new releases the second someone dumped the ROM online. There were some games that did not work properly back then, which I talked about in my [*Toy Story Racer* article](/articles/cgb-bt5e). I even already told the story of my exprience with *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. Let me tell it again. The first elevator of the game, encountered on the fourth mission, failed to move me to the next section of the facility. The second I pressed the elevator's button, I was stuck in there forever. I do not know if it was a bug or a voluntary anti-piracy measure. It would [appear that the game indeed has code to lock up emulators on the title screen](https://new.tcrf.net/Metal_Gear_Solid_(Game_Boy_Color)) and I wouldn't put it past the developpers at Konami to include piracy counter-measures later in the game. It's a great way to hide their emulator checking code.

It was very frustrating to hit an anti-piracy measure, especially since I remember playing through the game three times to verify I was really stuck: twice on the same emulator and a third time with a second one. Even though I was getting tired of repeating the early parts of the story, I bought the game. I had to, I was hooked. Its as if I had played a demo of the game, and was now convinced to buy it. Seriously, video games have forgotten the importance of demos.

- the AI
- the game is of its era. it has a ton of difficult puzzles that did not age well. the door one, the boxes factory.
- the story was a big element upon release. it had a full character arc for Snake. He starts the game willingly isolated, and strives to act upon the end of the game. (I need to check that?)
- it works by chapters. probably helped a lot with development to split it like that.
- it also saves by chapter. Its very frustrating.
- i was mesmerized by the game upon its release. i loved everything it did.
- the music. it's great.
- it got me interested in stealth games, and got me to buy the game that truly charmed me; *Thief 2: The Metal Age*.
- The game was developed by Tose. But all its developers seem to be fully credited on Mobygames (are they credited in the game) compared to a game like [Dragon Warrior III](https://www.mobygames.com/game/138514/dragon-warrior-iii/credits/gameboy-color/)
- The game was directed by [Shinta Nojiri](https://www.mobygames.com/person/57923/shinta-nojiri/) who went on to also direct the first Metal Gear Acid.
- They really did a chameleon thing of becoming a great developer. Jeremy Parsih talked about their work in an episode of GBworld.
- It's exciting to play and in my humble opinion more accomplished in terms of gameplay and situations than the Playstation game. It has the benefit of being made after it.
- I played the Playstation game after ... on PC.

I later played *Metal Gear Solid* when I bought a copy of its PC port. I have to share my views on *Metal Gear Solid*, which are very simple; it's great, but greatly flawed. For example, its story is simple yet full of ridiculously awesome twists and turns. When Miller removes his glasses, the animation is so well done and really punctuates the enormity of the reveal. Compared to that, when a cutscene uses the 3D graphics of the gameplay the only thing the characters can do are bob their heads up and down. That's disappointing; not only do the characters feature no facial animation, their heads are nearly featureless. The texture stretched across their polygonal faces use faint colours for mouths and eyes, which blends them within the void of their faces. So the game will have these long solliloquies where you're looking at Liquid Snake's blank face bobbing up and down. Many earlier Playstation or N64 titles had rudimentary facial animations; *Metal Gear Solid* was backwards in that regard. Under the column of great but greatly flawed, you can also count the gameplay. It's enemy AI is stupid sure, but it is properly defined. The soldiers will react stupidly but will not do frustrating things. However, the game has no persistence. Outside of lowering your secret final score being discovered has zero long term impact. You find a hiding spot to let the timer run out and the whole universe assumes you were never previously spotted with all the enemies you killed respawning. I played *Metal Gear Solid* well after *Thief II: The Metal Age* with its magnificient AI. Guards in that game react very realistically if they lose track of you: they will become paranoid motherfuckers looking for you in every dark corner, weapons at the ready while shouting at the top of their lungs that there's a thief somewhere. If other guards are within earshot, they'll come to help them investigate. Yep, *Thief II: The Metal Age* has a sound distance system that includes the guards' voice. Since *MGS* does not have any of that glorious persistence, I was unimpressed with the very on/off state of enemy soldiers. Of course this is explained by the limits of the PlayStation but also by the nature of *MGS*. In terms of gameplay the game is very much a 3D version of the 1990 MSX2 game. Not much in terms of gameplay is different between the two (except for that whole 3D thing). So the very severe limits of that 1990 game were brought forward to *Metal Gear Solid*. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. Proof in point, the Game Boy Color game had the same limits and there it worked magnificiently!

- Fuck the boxes factory.
- There is a hidden wreckage of the first Metal Gear robot-thingie [hidden in the last level](https://archive.org/details/metal-gear-solid-ghost-babel-perfect-guide/page/n79/mode/2up).
- Jenner dies. Don't act surprised. This is 0% surprising.
