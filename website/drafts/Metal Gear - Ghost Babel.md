I've spent my whole formative years watching the disappointing sequels to 80s movies without having seen the first one.
- I've seen *Ghostbusters 2* before the first one.
- *Alien 3* was my first Alien movie.
- Same thing for *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*, altough that's the best one.
- *Robocop 2* was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit.
- My first *Superman* was *Superman IV*.
- *City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold* was my first Billy Crystal movie.
- I only ever saw *Coccoon: The Return*, never the original.
- I managed to see Disneyâ€™s nightmarish *Return to Oz* before I saw the classic Judy Garland Technicolor masterpiece.
- *Bill and Ted 2* was the only one of the two I'd seen until I saw the first one much later.
- I loved the craziness and meta references of *Gremlins 2* without the need to see the original.
- Finally, like most of my friends I saw *Spaceballs* before I saw any *Star Wars* movie. I have to admit that the transformation of *Spaceball One* into *Mega Maid* was more impressive to me than any special effects in the first three *Star Wars*.

Which brings us to *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I played the Game Boy Color game before I ever touched the PlayStation classic. Once again I enjoyed the follow-up first.

Before we move on, we need to clarify nomenclature. Upon its release outside Japan, the Game Boy Color title discussed here was called *Metal Gear Solid*. That being **also** the name of the 1998 Playstation game, it would be unwieldy to constantly have to explain which of the two games I'm talking about. For this reason, I will refer to the Game Boy Color title by its original japanese name instead: *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. It's a nice name and a reference to the Game Boy. *MG: **GB***. Get it?

## Excitment

Back in the late 90s I did not have a Playstation but still wanted to play *Metal Gear Solid*. I was supremely interested; there was this video game that was supposedly as good as a movie! Of course, I had no idea back then that this was all marketing. *Metal Gear Solid* pretends to be a movie but is nothing like the serious films it tries to replicate. Hideo Kojima desperetaly wants to make games that are structured like serious spy thrillers, but he still writes soapy anime for edgy teenagers.

When Konami announced they were making a *Metal Gear* game for Game Boy Color, I was immediately interested. Initial images were very promising:

The people at Konami were not proposing strange gameplay mechanics that had very little to do with *Metal Gear Solid*. Many franchises coming to Game Boy would severely change their gameplay to fit the confines of the small console. *Ultima*, *Turok*, *Resident Evil*, *Perfect Dark*. Those are all franchises that drastically changed the gameplay for which they were known when they came to Game Boy. But here they were making a legitimate *Metal Gear* title. It even had a story told through cutscenes. To help you understand the convoluted story of *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*, I made a chart that covers the games' story and their development relationships.

{% include figure.html type="boxart-png" %}

When the game came out in March 2000, I have to remind you I pirated the game. In 2000, GBC emulators were good enough to play new releases as soon as someone dumped the ROM online. There were some games that did not work properly back then, which I talked about in my [*Toy Story Racer* article](/articles/cgb-bt5e). I even already told the story of my exprience with *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. Let me tell it again. The first elevator of the game, encountered on the fourth mission, failed to move me to the next section of the facility. The second I pressed the elevator's button, I was stuck in that elevator forever. In technical terms, I was softlocked. I could still move Solid Snake within the elevator, but I could never leave. I do not know if it was a bug or a voluntary anti-piracy measure. It would [appear that the game indeed has code to lock up emulators on the title screen](https://new.tcrf.net/Metal_Gear_Solid_(Game_Boy_Color)) and I wouldn't put it past the developpers at TOSE to include piracy counter-measures later in the game. I'm not competent enough to test my theory, but keep in mind dear reader that modern emulators are now indistinguishable from real hardware. No anti-piracy code can get triggered anymore.

It was very frustrating to hit a wall like that, especially since I played through the game three times to verify I was really stuck: twice on the same emulator and a third time with a second one that also softlocked. Even though I was getting tired of repeating the early parts of the story, I still caved and bought the game. I had to, I was hooked. I had played the equivalent of a demo and was now convinced to buy it. It's unfortunate that to this day so few demos exist.

## The Development Structure

We cannot talk about *Metal Gear* without talking about Hideo Kojima at some point. The dude is synonymous with those games because he's the main creator of the first game, he's the most important voice in their development, but he's far from the only one. Case in point, the director of *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel* is Shinta Nojiri. Hideo Kojima was only a supervisor.

{% include figure.html type="art" class="float left" figcaption="Shinta Nojiri in a bathtub for some reason." %}

Shinta Nojiri was fairly new within Konami, having only worked on the PlayStation port of *Policenauts*. After that game, there's a very conspicuous gap in his resume before he worked on *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I think he might have worked uncredited on *Metal Gear Solid* as a sort of fixer. Someone who comes in to help complete a project, usually accompanied with ungodly amounts of crunch. It's conjecture on my part, but it would help explain why this very young inexperienced developper was then chosen to direct *Ghost Babel*. Finally, the game was developed with the help of TOSE. Just to jog your memory, they are a shadowy japanese company that works as a secret contractor, often even as a sub-contractor. They're a large company, responsible for the development of many games and neither the company nor their employees receive credit for their work. The stories we hear about their development structure is that you send them as much design elements as possible and they finish the game on time and on budget, without a iota of effort above that. They are not a studio that goes above and beyond.

With the development of *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*, a different approach was taken. [Shinta Nojiri actually moved from Tokyo to Kyoto and was physically embedded within the offices of TOSE](https://hg101.kontek.net/metalgear/shintanojiri.htm) It's the first time I hear of a developper physically moving to work with TOSE. It obviously helped to bring the game to fruition, but Nojiri was the only Konami developper working directly with TOSE. I think the game's flaws exist because he was the only person from Konami supervising the work directly. There was only so much he could do to bring the tender love and care a game of this scope needs. Case in point, the level design.

## Level Design Makes or Breaks a Classic

{% include figure.html type="gb" class="left" %}
The level design in *MG:GB* is messy. Every room, taken in isolation, is okay. Some rooms only exist to enhance gameplay, but I can forgive those rooms. It's how each and every room connects with one another that makes no sense. If you enter a building and explore different floors of that structure, the size is different from floor to floor. Elevators are placed where it makes gameplay sense, not architectural sense. Security rooms, full of traps and hazards, are placed between two corridors, protecting the entrance of nothing of value. You might think this has no impact on gameplay, but with a game focused on exploring bases to stealthily accomplish nebulous objectives, it's important to understand the layout of your environment. It's the game's greatest flaw, and I think the level design problems are due to Shinta Nojiri letting the staff of TOSE designing the levels themselves. It looks like something that was made quickly with the tiles they had, without a lot of attention paid to the players' sense of space. Here's a great example: the power plant mission.

You have to find four structural pillars inside a power plant, and put C4 on them. You do that because you intend to collapse the whole building to  cut the power to Metal Gear. It's an inventive objective, made frustrating by the nonsensical floor plan of the power plant. Since the space you're in makes no sense, finding the pillars turns into exploring every room from corner to corner to make sure you haven't missed one. You cannot simply go to the four corners of the map to logically find the pillars. The dreaded box factory is another potent example. It could be made more fun if the relationships between the conveyor belt exits and the lower floors made more sense. Instead, you're dealing with a building without logic. That makes the game's worst level even more frustrating.

The whole game is strewn with those little paper cuts. You'll often find complete dead-ends with no usage whatsoever in a level. That's commendable since it could add realism (dead-ends without a clear purpose exist in real life after all) but in this case it doesn't work. Some of the connections between areas are visually confusing. In the second level, you have to find a side outcropping of a building to reach a back entrance. It does not look like there's an access hatch there.

{% include figure.html type="gb" figcaption="The outcropping in question." %}

I think there are issues with readability because of the colour limits of the Game Boy Color. They can't always use a different shade to indicate a different element. When you get in the sewer, there are puddles of water on the ground. So far so good. Some puddles look awesome. Sue me, I love little details like that. Other puddles are far more difficult to visually  understand.

{% include figure.html type="gb" figcaption="This puddle looks like a hole in the ground you should fall through." %}

Often, you can't make sense of the areas you're looking at. I think they knew about the problem, since they always introduce a new area without enemies or challenge so you can figure out your environment without stress. On the other hand, the game features night vision goggles that work during the whole game. It's a testament to their attention to detail where it matters. If you want to find beautiful level design that showcases the capabilities of the game, you have to play the VR Training.

## VR

The VR challenges redeem the level design for me. Yeah, the story levels aren't as good as they should, but those VR missions are so much fun. The portable nature of Game Boy even allows you to knock out a couple of them anytime you want, without having to suffer the slow loading speed of a Playstation's CD. Truly a great part of the game that I wished was even longer.

<div class="gallery">

The VR challenges made me appreciate stealth gameplay, and I ended up wanting more. This ultimately led me to *Thief II: The Metal Age* on PC, the most accomplished game I ever played in my life. But you're not here to talk about the VR challenges or *Thief II*, you're playing Metal Gear for the story, right?

## The Goddamn Story

By the end of *Metal Gear Solid*, Solid Snake has rescued the girl (or the boy?), killed his clone brother, resolved his painful relationship with the robot ninja, and solved the mystery of people mysteriously dying around him during his mission. I guess he also saved the world. It's a convoluted ending, but it fits together nicely. Then the second game happens, and I feel like the whole story fell off the tracks. There's supposedly an AI colonel, incest, I think actually two cases of incest, ten Metal Gear vehicles who look like noodles, there's a vampire in there somewhere, another AI who runs the world, and the main villain of our story is the arm of Liquid Snake attached to Revolver Ocelot thus controlling him. Oh and you don't play as Solid Snake, you play as a new character that's really hard to love. It's the worst of Japanese excess.

I do not like the story after the Playstation title. It goes up its own butt, comes out the mouth, and goes back up its own butt a second time for good measure.

Here, I'm happy to report that the story is simple, like the early MSX 2 titles so I do not hate it. You have to read between the lines a bit. But I assure you, it's got a proper, if barebones, Metal Gear story. There's the same difficult relationship with war and conflict, the same questions raised at our sheltered way of life. It's just on Game Boy, so it's very limited in scope. Their efforts are commendable, but sometimes you can't help but laugh. After every boss battle, you're treated to the exact same thing. The defeated boss lies on the ground explaining their whole terrible life to Solid Snake. Think about how ridiculous that is for a second. On top of that, they all have horrible circumstances imposed on them, making them into perfect victims not deserving of death. The same thing happened in *Metal Gear Solid* with the same lesson: in war, everyone is a victim. It's commendable but by the fourth time it happens you start to giggle at the pattern's repetition. It feels like someone writing a copy of *Metal Gear Solid*, and I mean that in the best possible sense. Hideo Kojima would make his games ever more convoluted, and I think their story lost the simple charm of the first three Metal Gear games he made. *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*, because it was developed concurrently with *Metal gear Solid 2* can only ape those three simpler titles, and the game is better for it.

I guess I have to talk about the canon status of the game. There are discussions that the game is the final VR training of Raiden or that the game isn't canon. It leaves an aura of uselessness around the game, putting the game in a state of limbo, telling prospective players that it does not matter. That's a thing I do not like. Too often these days, canon status equates to existence. If a piece of art isn't canon, it no longer exists. Regarding these matters, I instead take an author-centric approach. The game was made with limited input from Hideo Kojima, the main driving force behind the story of the franchise. Kojima never revisited its events, so that's where it stands. No need to attach a strict label when the game's production history easily describes its position. Is it canon? It doesn't really matter.

If we need to talk about one label, its that it was designed from the get-go as a gaiden title. Japanese gaidens (literally side story) are stories that stand to the side of the main narrative thrust. They tend to focus less on respecting the exact details of a timeline, and to instead provide further stories surrounding the characters. Those stories are not meant to propel the narrative forward, but to be a way to spend more time with the characters of an already existing narrative. In our specific case, *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel* seems to disregard the events of *Metal Gear 2*, and seems to happen instead of *Metal Gear Solid*. Maybe I don't pay enough attention to tiny details, but to me this makes no sense. *Ghost Babel* could totally happen between the second MSX game and *Metal Gear Solid*. Again, I don't care a lot about those things. I care enough to make a chart for this article, but I made that chart to highlight the ridiculous situation.

## A passable AI

I've talked time and time again that the Game Boy can't do convincing artificial intelligence with enemy characters. Its processor is simply not fast enough to reserve large chunks of compute time to calculate complex decision trees. Instead, enemies resort to simple clauses. *If the player character is close to you, run towards him*. That sort of thing. But you know what isn't fast enough for convincing AI as well? The MSX.

The old Metal Gear titles ran on the same family of processor as the Game Boy Color, and they managed to have somewhat convincing enemies with only  half the processor speed. They managed it by designing around the problem.

- three enemies on the board at once max.
- simple clauses, well implemented (if Snake is at a certain distance, shoot him, if alert finishes, leave as fast as possible)
- the enemies in Metal Gear aren't really more complex than the ghosts in Pac-Man.

- tons of little challenges. Water in the sewers, cameras that go up and down, invisible lasers, dogs. Fucking dogs.

## Damn Boxes
- the game is of its era. it has a ton of difficult puzzles that did not age well. the door one, the boxes factory.
- the box factory doesn't work because the conveyor belt exits have no strict link with where they lead. It's all a jumbled mess that doesn't make logical sense.
- you have to go through the door puzzle twice!
- I took so long at the second puzzle a guy just came out and unlocked all the doors for me.


- it works by chapters. probably helped a lot with development to split it like that.
- it also saves by chapter. Its very frustrating.
- i was mesmerized by the game upon its release. i loved everything it did.
- the music. it's great.
- the story isn't too long, with a lot of what it does repetititve.

-

- There is a hidden wreckage of the first Metal Gear robot-thingie [hidden in the last level](https://archive.org/details/metal-gear-solid-ghost-babel-perfect-guide/page/n79/mode/2up).

## Conclusion

Once **I** was done with *Metal Gear:Ghost Babel**, I did the only sensible thing a kid with a Nintendo 64 could do: I bought the PC version of *Metal Gear Solid*. This version of the game is still playable today, [courtesy of GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/metal_gear_solid). It's a solid port. I don't remember having any issues with the game back then. They've adapted the Psycho Mantis fight, and you lose some graphical effects, but the game runs better and at a **much much** higher resolution.

I liked it a lot back then, but it never felt right to play that game on a PC. I afterwards tried to play *Metal Gear Solid 3* two times. Once on PS2 and a second time on 3DS of all places. I could not care enough to play it. I recently gave a shot to *Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain*, and while I was utterly impressed by the depth of its gameplay systems, the game felt too repetitive for me. I guess the whole Metal Gear concept never really impressed me outside of the revival on Playstation and the Game Boy Color experiment. I've greatly appreciated the replay I did for this article, and recommend it. It's weird that it exists, and it's a whole lot of fun.
