I've spent my whole formative years watching the sequels to 80s movies without having seen the first one. I've seen *Ghostbusters 2* before the first one. *Alien 3* was my first Alien movie. Same thing for *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*, altough that's arguably the best one. *Robocop 2* was my introduction to the best cop in Detroit. My first *Superman* was *Superman IV*. *City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold* was my first Billy Crystal movie. I only ever saw *Coccoon: The Return*, never the original. *Bill and Ted 2* was the only one of the two I'd seen until I saw the first one much later. I loved the craziness and meta references of *Gremlins 2* before I ever saw the original. Finally, like most of my friends I saw *Spaceballs* before I saw any *Star Wars* movie. I have to admit that the transformation of *Spaceball One* into *Mega Maid* was more impressive to me than any special effects in the first three *Star Wars*.

Which brings us to *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I played the Game Boy Color game before I ever touched the PlayStation classic. Once again I enjoyed the follow-up first.

Before we move on, we need to clarify nomenclature. Upon its release outside Japan, the Game Boy Color title discussed here was called *Metal Gear Solid*. That being **also** the name of the 1998 Playstation game, it would be unwieldy to constantly have to explain which of the two games I'm talking about. For this reason, I will refer to the Game Boy Color title by its original japanese name instead: *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. It's a nice name and a reference to the Game Boy. *MG: **GB***. Get it?

Back in the late 90s I did not have a Playstation but still wanted to play *Metal Gear Solid*. I was supremely interested; there was this video game that was supposedly as good as a movie! Of course, I had no idea back then that this was all marketing. *Metal Gear Solid* pretends it's like a movie but it is nothing like the serious films it tries to replicate. Hideo Kojima desperetaly wants to make games that are structured like serious spy thrillers, but he still writes stupid anime for edgy teenagers.

When Konami announced they were making a *Metal Gear* game for Game Boy Color, I was immediately interested. Initial images were very promising:

The people at Konami were not proposing strange gameplay mechanics that had very little to do with *Metal Gear Solid*. Many franchises coming to Game Boy would severely change their gameplay to fit the confines of the small console. *Ultima*, *Turok*, *Resident Evil*, *Perfect Dark*. Those are all franchises that drastically changed the gameplay for which they were known when they came to Game Boy. But here they were making a legitimate *Metal Gear* title. It even had a story told through cutscenes. To help you understand the convoluted placement of *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel* within the rest of the games, I made a chart that covers both the games' story and their development.

I have to remind you I pirated the game initially. In 2000, GBC emulators were good enough to play new releases as soon as someone dumped the ROM online. There were some games that did not work properly back then, which I talked about in my [*Toy Story Racer* article](/articles/cgb-bt5e). I even already told the story of my exprience with *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. Let me tell it again. The first elevator of the game, encountered on the fourth mission, failed to move me to the next section of the facility. The second I pressed the elevator's button, I was stuck in there forever. I do not know if it was a bug or a voluntary anti-piracy measure. It would [appear that the game indeed has code to lock up emulators on the title screen](https://new.tcrf.net/Metal_Gear_Solid_(Game_Boy_Color)) and I wouldn't put it past the developpers at Konami to include piracy counter-measures later in the game. I'm not competent enough to test my theory, but keep in mind dear reader that modern emulators are now indistinguishable from real hardware. No anti-piracy code can get triggered anymore.

It was very frustrating to hit a wall like that, especially since I played through the game three times to verify I was really stuck: twice on the same emulator and a third time with a second one that also softlocked. Even though I was getting tired of repeating the early parts of the story, I still bought the game. I had to, I was hooked. I had played the equivalent of a demo of the game and was now convinced to buy it. Seriously, where have demos gone? I know they're a serious pain to make for developers, but it's a great loss so few of them exist.

I had intended to write this intense deep dive into the game, but a five-minute online search led me to find this wonderful [2022 retrospective on the game from Renan Fontes on Goomba Stomp](https://goombastomp.com/metal-gear-ghost-babel-game-boy-color-retrospective/). Renan said everything in his article I wanted to say about the game! In his article, he gives a lot of credence to the improvements *Metal Gear Solid* brought to the franchise and how they're represented in this game. It's informed a lot by the PlayStation game, but it's a lot more like the older MSX2 game in gameplay. The sprite work is echoing the style of *Metal Gear Solid*, but the game is built on the trappings of the 1990 game, not the 1998 one. The team at Konami, like a bad magician, were just repackaging the same old trick they had already done once before. The magic trick was very simple: bring the gameplay of their 1990 MSX2 game *Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake* to another platform. The story is a sequel, and the levels are of course different, but the core gameplay is the same as the previous game. That's what they already did with the Playstation game *Metal Gear Solid*. They brought the gameplay of the MSX2 to a 3D game on Playstation and now they would bring the gameplay of the MSX2 to Game Boy Color.

They ended up making a great game but not without its flaws.

## The Development Structure

We cannot talk about *Metal Gear* without talking about Hideo Kojima. The dude is synonymous with those games because he's the most important voice in their development. But he's far from the only one. Case in point, the director of this game is Shinta Nojiri. Hideo Kojima was only a supervisor with the development of this game.

Shinta Nojiri was fairly new within Konami, having only worked on the PlayStation port of *Policenauts*. After that game, there's a very conspicuous gap in his before *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I think he might have worked uncredited on *Metal Gear Solid* as a sort of fixer. Someone who comes in to help complete a project, usually accompanied with ungodly amounts of crunch. It's conjecture on my part, but it would help explain why this very young inexperienced developper was then chosen to direct the game.

Finally, the game was developed with the help of TOSE. Just to jog your memory, they are a shadowy japanese company that is sub-contracted to make a game. They're a large company, responsible for the development of many games and it is customary for the company's employees to go uncredited.

[Shinta Nojiri moved to Kyoto and was embedded within the company](https://hg101.kontek.net/metalgear/shintanojiri.htm) It's the first time I hear of a developper moving to work with TOSE.

## Level Design Makes a Classic

The level design in MG:GB is messy and I think its explained by its development. Compared with MGS the buildings you explore are confusing and unrealistic. MGS has the benefit of a hard limit; it's a fully 3d game on PlayStation, which meant the developpers had hard limits on what they could make that didn't exceed the Playstation's capability. It needed to be simple, so they couldn't spare complex level design, but MG:GB's worse problem isn't even the complexity of each room. It's how each and every room connects with one another. The dreaded box factory could be made more fun if the relationships between the conveyor belt exits and the lower floors made more sense. Instead, you're dealing with a building that makes no sense. That makes the experience far more frustrating.

MGS also has the benefit of being a straight line from start to finish. You're always heading north. Being constructed with self-contained levels, MG:GB has a lot more flexibility with its overarching structure. As a great example, you have to find four pillars inside a power plant to blow it up  near the end of the game. It's an inventive objective, made frustrating by the nonsensical floor plan of the power plant. Since the space you're in makes no sense, finding the pillars turns into exploring every room from corner to corner to make sure you haven't missed one.

I think the problems with the level design are due to Shinta Nojiri letting the staff of TOSE designing the levels themselves. It looks like something that was made quickly with the tiles they had, without a lot of attention paid to the players' sense of space. If you want to find beautiful level design that showcases the capabilities of the game, you have to play the VR Training.












- the AI
- three enemies on the board at once max.
- tons of little challenges. Water in the sewers, cameras that go up and down, invisible lasers, dogs. Fucking dogs.

- there are often complete dead-ends. That's commendable, but a lot of rooms are repeated wholesale.
- some of the links between areas are visually confusing. In the second level, there's this side outcropping that you have to find. It looks nothing like there's a door there.
- Some puddles look awesome. Others, not so much. This one looks like a black void.
- The game hits the colour limits of the system. Sometimes, you can't make sense of the areas you're looking at. I think they knew about the problem, and they always introduce a new area without enemies or challenge so you can figure out what it is you're looking at.
- On the other hand, the game features night vision goggles that work during the whole game. It's a testament to their attention to detail.

After every boss battle, you're treated to the exact same thing. The defeated boss lies on the ground explaining their whole terrible life to Solid Snake. Think about how ridiculous that is for a second. On top of that, they all have horrible circumstances imposed on them, making them into perfect victims not deserving of death. The same thing happened in *Metal Gear Solid* with the same lesson: in war, everyone is a victim. It's commendable but by the fourth time it happens you start to laugh at the pattern.

- the game is of its era. it has a ton of difficult puzzles that did not age well. the door one, the boxes factory.
- the box factory doesn't work because the conveyor belt exits have no strict link with where they lead. It's all a jumbled mess that doesn't make logical sense.
- you have to go through the door puzzle twice!
- I took so long at the second puzzle a guy just came out and unlocked all the doors for me.
- the story was a big element upon release. it had a full character arc for Snake. He starts the game willingly isolated, and strives to act upon the end of the game. (I need to check that?)
- it works by chapters. probably helped a lot with development to split it like that.
- it also saves by chapter. Its very frustrating.
- i was mesmerized by the game upon its release. i loved everything it did.
- the music. it's great.
- the story isn't too long, with a lot of what it does repetititve.
- the VR training is a real highlight, and what really gets you to come back and play Metal Gear Solid for a long time.
- I hated the VR missions on PSX for their long load times; here you don't get that of course.
- it got me interested in stealth games, and got me to buy the game that truly charmed me; *Thief 2: The Metal Age*.
- The game was developed by Tose. But all its developers seem to be fully credited on Mobygames (are they credited in the game) compared to a game like [Dragon Warrior III](https://www.mobygames.com/game/138514/dragon-warrior-iii/credits/gameboy-color/)
- The game was directed by [Shinta Nojiri](https://www.mobygames.com/person/57923/shinta-nojiri/) who went on to also direct the first Metal Gear Acid.
- They really did a chameleon thing of becoming a great developer. Jeremy Parsih talked about their work in an episode of GBworld.
- It's exciting to play and in my humble opinion more accomplished in terms of gameplay and situations than the Playstation game. It has the benefit of being made after it.
- I played the Playstation game after ... on PC.
- Fuck the boxes factory.
- There is a hidden wreckage of the first Metal Gear robot-thingie [hidden in the last level](https://archive.org/details/metal-gear-solid-ghost-babel-perfect-guide/page/n79/mode/2up).
- Jenner dies. Don't act surprised. This is 0% surprising.

I later played *Metal Gear Solid* when I bought a copy of its PC port. *Metal Gear Solid* is great, but greatly flawed. For example, its story is simple yet full of ridiculously awesome twists and turns. When Miller removes his glasses, the animation is so well done and really punctuates the enormity of the reveal you're witnessing. Compared to that, when a cutscene uses the 3D graphics of the gameplay the only thing the characters can do are bob their heads up and down. That's disappointing; not only do the characters feature no facial animation, their heads are nearly featureless. The texture stretched across their polygonal faces use faint colours for mouths and eyes, which blends them within the void of their faces. So the game will have these long solliloquies where you're looking at Liquid Snake's blank face bobbing up and down. Many earlier Playstation or N64 titles had rudimentary facial animations; *Metal Gear Solid* was backwards in that regard. Under the column of great but greatly flawed, you can also count the gameplay. It's enemy AI is stupid, but it is properly defined. The soldiers will react stupidly but will not do frustrating things. However, the game has no persistence. Being discovered has zero long term impact, outside of lowering your secret final score. When you find a hiding spot to let the timer run out, the whole universe of the game assumes you were never previously spotted with all the enemies you killed simply respawning. No one is impressed when you compare that simple AI behaviour with the insane level of details you could experience in *Thief II: The Metal Age*. Guards in that game react very realistically if they lose track of you: they will become paranoid motherfuckers looking for you in every dark corner, weapons at the ready while shouting at the top of their lungs that there's a thief somewhere. If other guards are within earshot, they'll come to help them investigate. Yep, *Thief II: The Metal Age* has a sound detection system that includes the guards' own voice. Since *MGS* does not have any of that glorious persistence, I was unimpressed with the same on/off state of enemy soldiers I had seen in *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel*. I thought it made sense for the puny Game Boy; to see the same AI behaviour on PlayStation was disheartening.

Of course this is explained by the limits of the PlayStation but also by the nature of *Metal Gear Solid*. In terms of gameplay the game is very much a 3D version of the 1990 MSX2 game. They added wall-hugging, mostly to allow you to peek at corners, but the gameplay is fundamentally the same. So the very severe limits of that 1990 game were brought forward to *Metal Gear Solid*. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. Proof in point, the Game Boy Color game had the same limits and there it worked magnificiently!
