This is the conclusion
My wife always tells me I have no friends. I'm not atypical, I'm only a man of my generation. We have a structural problem of creating and maintaining healthy friendships. All that to say that if like me you're a friendless man you can fire up the old Game Boy to try the Pokémon Trading Card Game.

A chapter about modern horror

Fire up a modern card game like *Magic: The Gathering Arena* or *Marvel Snap* and you're in for a modern panopticon of [dark patterns](). You will be bombarded by insipid rewards after every single thing you do in the interface. And the interface is somehow always very complex, filled with ever so slightly different sections arranged in tabs. There's always multiple notification systems to keep you engaged with what they're trying to tell you. *Arena* features a facsimile of an email system and notification dots that appear pretty much anywhere they want.

My point is that modern card games are all the same in the exact same way whenever you're outside a card game. They're all like that for one reason; to get you to spend money. All the card games are invariably free, forever trying to get you to spend money for this or that. They'll give you some of the interesting. But invariably, the rate at which you gain cards will slow down, dialed in by statisticians working day and night to figure out the exact rate at which they should slow their rewards so you're tempted to spend money.

The Game Boy Pokémon TCG is a glass of cold water in hell compared to this capitalist hellscape. You want more cards? You get two every time you win a match. That's it. No bullshit, no manipulation of your dopamine level to entice you to spend real money on fake money. You want the rarer packs? Go beat the Elite Four again.

While you couldn't reverse a coin flip, you could undo it. So I would do an action, look at the coin flip and if it was negative I would turn off the Game Boy and restart my turn, knowing that the coin flip would not go my way. Armed with


## Introduction
In 1998, I was in a class of language nerds, fresh out of elementary school, ready to take on the beautiful and scary world of high school. Not a week had gone by that the older secondary 3 kids had introduced us to this crazy card game with magic spells and monsters! What proceeded to happen was a seismic shift in what my friends and I did during lunch. *Magic: The Gathering* took my cow town high school by storm.

A group of around 35 kids, all boys except for one girl, would talk about *Magic* before classes started, play *Magic* during lunch, and buy, sell, and trade cards after school to play some more. It felt like a relentless new experience I had to join. I jumped in the trend, and bought a bunch of cards from people to start my own deck. To keep things inexpensive for me, I played white. Nobody played white. The pictures weren't cool enough. If you wanted something unpretentious you might play blue, but no one but me used a white deck. Is that even a thing anymore, a single colour deck? Anyway, my colour choice allowed me to get some useful cards easily. Nobody was interested in keeping their white cards. Like I said, the pictures weren't cool enough. Who wants pictures of saccharine angels, old dudes, and wheat fields?

But I never quite took a liking to *Magic*. It's rules about creatures never quite agreed with my own logic about what **should** happen. I always felt that damage should be permanent on creatures. I believe you should be able to eventually kill those 6/6 green tree monsters with continued attacks of 2/4 white dudes with poleaxes. To sidestep my dislike of creature rules, I exclusively used shadow creatures. Shadow creatures were a new addition to Magic, so I felt like I was at the cutting edge. That helped me feel better when I always lost to the same people with much older, but far stronger, decks.

All that to say that I'm not the person to play something forever. Instead of shaking things up constantly until it's no longer exciting and new, I experiment with something to find the core conceit, the richest nugget of fun. Then I move on to other things.

There was another card game played back in high school: the *Star Wars Customizable Card Game* (not to be confused with the similarly named *Star Wars Trading Card Game*). There was a big problem, however. The same two guys, who weren't my friends, were the only ones playing it. It never seemed an appealing prospect to join such a small scene. My second chance at a new card game came with the arrival of the *Pokémon Trading Card Game* to my local video rental store in 1999. I bought a starter pack that came with two prebuilt decks so I could rope in my friends to play with me. There was just one problem. None of my friends thought it was cool to play card games anymore. They had discovered this new hobby called alcohol. Some of my friends were still playing *Magic*, but it was a love of *Magic* itself that was driving them; they had nothing but derision for the baby game with cute creatures. So I only ever played two games of the *Pokémon TCG*. Once with my sister and another time before a *Magic* session with friends.

Then later in 2000 came salvation with the release of the *Pokémon Trading Card Game* for **Game Boy**. My lonely love of Game Boy was once again paying off!
