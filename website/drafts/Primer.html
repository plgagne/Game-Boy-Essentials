<h2 id="buying-a-game-boy">Buying a Game Boy</h2>

<p>Playing Game Boy games is not as straightforward as you might think. Throughout its long history, a litany of devices were released that can play the varied family of Game Boy cartridges. This is without counting the incredible amount of third-party modifications made to original hardware, and completely independent devices that can play Game Boy cartridges. So we&#8217;ll ultimately look at the devices you can choose to play Game Boy titles, but first we&#8217;ll explore the different cartridge types you could play and the characteristics of each one. This will help you understand the choices you should make when choosing a device to play.</p>

<h3 id="grey-cartridges">Grey Cartridges</h3>

<p>The first cartridge type is the original grey. They have nothing inherently special about them. They feature the famous notch on the left side of the cartridge and will play on anything with the name Game Boy (except the Game Boy Micro). The following devices will play those grey cartridges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy</li>
  <li>Super Game Boy</li>
  <li>Game Boy Pocket</li>
  <li>Super Game Boy 2</li>
  <li>Game Boy Light</li>
  <li>Game Boy Color</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance SP</li>
  <li>Game Boy Player</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance SP AGB-101</li>
</ul>

<p>The following device will not play those cartridges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy Micro</li>
</ul>

<p>The inset, the small rectangle within the game&#8217;s cover art, is used to display whether the game is a multiplayer or a single player experience. Japanese cartridges do not use the inset, using a small logo somewhere in the cover art instead. Later Players&#8217; Choice reissues also removed this inset.</p>

<h3 id="grey-cartridges-featuring-super-game-boy-functionality">Grey Cartridges Featuring Super Game Boy Functionality</h3>

<p>There is a subset of grey cartridges who feature Super Game Boy functionnality. While games without Super Game Boy support will play on the Super Nintendo device but use standard colour palettes, cartrdiges with Super Game Boy functionnality will have a custom TV border <em>and</em> custom color palettes when played on the Super Game Boy. The Super Game Boy was released alongside <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and it is the game with the best support for it. <a href="http://loveconquersallgam.es/post/2379636248/fuck-the-super-game-boy-donkey-kong">Christine Love has the best article on the subject</a>. To denote Super Game Boy functionnality, the inset used to display multiplayer is now instead used to display the presence of Super Game Boy enhancements. Once again, japanese cartidges do not feature this inset.</p>

<h3 id="black-cartridges">Black Cartridges</h3>

<p>When the Game Boy Color was released, the black cartridges were introduced. Their packaging featured the Game Boy Color word mark on the left side of the box, but those are still Game Boy games, denoted by the left side notch, albeit with black coloured plastic. That black coloured cart is a promise to the player: <em>This game will play on systems older than a Game Boy Color</em>. The following devices will play black cartridges using the original Game Boy code path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy</li>
  <li>Super Game Boy</li>
  <li>Game Boy Pocket</li>
  <li>Super Game Boy 2</li>
  <li>Game Boy Light</li>
</ul>

<p>The following devices will be able to access the Game Boy Color enhancments of the cartridge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy Color</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance SP</li>
  <li>Game Boy Player</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance SP AGB-101</li>
</ul>

<p>The following device will not play those cartridges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy Micro</li>
</ul>

<p>How that promise is achieved is the same for the overwhelming majority of titles. They are Game Boy titles (denoted by their product ID still starting with DMG, the code for the original Game Boy) with specific colours when played on a Game Boy Color or later. These games have specific Game Boy Color palettes, but they cannot use the faster CPU speed of the Game Boy Color due to their backward compatibility. Theses games <strong>also</strong> use separate Super Game Boy palettes, different from their GBC palettes, since the Super Game Boy and Game Boy Color have incompatible colouring schemes.</p>

<p>There are weird edge cases of games that achieve the compatibility promise differently. Games like <em>Conker&#8217;s Pocket Tales</em>, <em>Wario Land II</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda DX</em> that run the whole gamut from <em>very small changes</em> to <em>completely different game</em> wether you play them on a Game Boy or Game Boy Color. On top of all this madness, some titles were originally released in grey cartridges and rereleased later on black cartridges. This includes <em>Wario Land II</em>, which was originally released right before the Game Boy Color came out, and was quickly rereleased to take advantage of the new system. Another example, <em>Harvest Moon GB</em>, got retitled <em>Harvest Moon GB<strong>C</strong></em> for its black cartridge rerelease.</p>

<h3 id="clear-cartridges">Clear Cartridges</h3>

<p>Then comes the final type of cartridge, the clear cartridge. These do not feature the notch, meaning a Game Boy will not be able to physically start with them inserted. They will start on the Game Boy Pocket or Super Game Boy but will only display a message saying the game cannot be played on a Game Boy (technically they do run on the Game Boy, the issue being the only thing they display is a screen saying it won&#8217;t play on that particular system; an interesting case of an oxymoron).</p>

<p>The following devices can play clear cartridge games:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy Color</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance SP</li>
  <li>Game Boy Player</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance SP AGB-101</li>
</ul>

<p>The following devices will not play those cartridges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Boy</li>
  <li>Super Game Boy</li>
  <li>Game Boy Pocket</li>
  <li>Super Game Boy 2</li>
  <li>Game Boy Light</li>
  <li>Game Boy Micro</li>
</ul>

<p>Those feature the CGB code in their product ID, denoting they are for a completely different system. Their packaging featured the Game Boy Color word mark <strong>and</strong> a little triangle on the right side of the box with the words <em>only for Game Boy Color</em>. Just to make things more complicated, starting with <em>Pokémon Crystal</em> in 2001 that little triangle disappeared and only the back of the game&#8217;s box indicated the title was a clear cartridge for Game Boy Color only. Japanese packaging has always used only the box&#8217;s back to denote compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="which-game-boy-should-i-play">Which Game Boy Should I Play?</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most important advice: if you own anything that can play Game Boy cartridges, use what you have. There are no bad Game Boy consoles made by Nintendo R&amp;D1. However, I&#8217;ll try to help you choose what to purchase since each and every device R&amp;D1 made has flaws. Because no Game Boy device is perfect, this has lead to a dedicated modding community that constantly modifies original devices to try to improve on those flawed devices. This includes modifications to add backlights, installing strange displays, replacing plastic pieces with better materials, putting logic boards inside other devices, etc. Enjoying Game Boy, in my view, is much simpler if the player accepts a device&#8217;s inherent flaws.</p>

<p>That being said, if you wish to embark on the endeavour, we will explore common modifications after we introduce and discuss all the devices. Let&#8217;s begin with the original Game Boy.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-dmg-01-the-original-grey-game-boy-brick">Game Boy DMG-01, the Original Grey Game Boy Brick</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never experienced the original DMG-01 before, I&#8217;d say you should strive to play one. The console is very confortable to hold for long periods of time and features chunky buttons with awesome actuations. The mono speaker is big and loud; a lot of older titles have music that is tuned to sound good through this exact speaker. All in all the whole console is the undiluted original console, and I think a necessary experience for any serious Game Boy player. It was initially released in 1989 in grey and was joined by coloured cases much later in 1995.</p>

<p>Keep in mind these original consoles are getting really old; if you find a cheap one it might be severely banged up and in need of some love. Buying a Game Boy is not like buying any TV console; those spend their lives underneath a television so they stay in good condition. A Game Boy has spent its life on the move, mostly with kids, so they tend to get dirty and scratched. You will therefore need to pay very good attention to the device to make sure you buy something you&#8217;re happy with.</p>

<p>The original Game Boy also has its lot of drawbacks. Its screen is old-fashioned since it&#8217;s an inexpensive low-power monochrome pixel display called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-twisted_nematic_display">super-twisted nematic LCD</a>. Their main quality is their power consumption and cheap cost, which is in no way beneficial to the modern player, and their drawbacks are serious and aggravating. The version R&amp;D1 used is monochrome with a famously poor colour palette of dark green on light green. Even with these very evident surface problems, the most serious drawback with the screen is the ghosting. Seldom talked about, the amount of display lag on a DMG-01 is shocking. You have to experience it to understand how this display lag is the worst problem of the original device. The whole Game Boy experience from 1989 to 2001, even on other devices with better screens, had to be shaped by this screen&#8217;s pixel lag. Fast-paced games had to be deliberately designed to work with it. Graphics had to be designed with ghosting in mind if they ever hoped to look good. Some game concepts were even unfeasible with such a poor screen. All these problems were in no way showstoppers, since the Game Boy was always a promise between its players and its inventors: we know the screen is not great, but trust us, we&#8217;re Nintendo, we&#8217;ll make it work. To understand this compact, you need to play the original grey brick.</p>

<p>The screen has no front or back light, which was ultimately a wise design choice on R&amp;D1&#8217;s part for 1989 but a vexing issue when other companies&#8217; devices had backlights. The light problem can be helped with a third-party worm light but the best solution comes from thinking outside the device itself; I installed nice wall lights above my couch that directly point down. That way, I enjoy a great viewing angle on any old unlit Game Boy when I&#8217;m on my couch, where I play almost every time.</p>

<p>In terms of repairs, I&#8217;m fairly careful with my systems and I had to open up and restore some elements of my own grey bricks I&#8217;ve owned since 1990; I&#8217;ve changed the buttons&#8217; rubbery membranes (they had broken after decades of use), I replaced the screen&#8217;s protective plastic (again broken due to age) and because some vertical lines had stopped displaying anything, I had to use the hair dryer trick to restore some of the screen’s lines (the connector for the screen separates over time, which can be fixed by heating up the connector so it reforms). For me, who has repaired Apple devices, I have to say opening up and repairing a Game Boy DMG-01 is easy. Their interiors are big, the screws make sense, and the only careful operation is making sure you don&#8217;t break the fragile display connector. Unfortunately, the screen protector is made of plastic and glued in place, which will require frustrating cleanup with old dried glue if you need to change that.</p>

<h3 id="super-game-boy-the-magic-cartridge">Super Game Boy, the Magic Cartridge</h3>

<p>Next, chronologically, is the Super Game Boy, the Super Nintendo cartridge that houses a full Game Boy within. You put a game in it and you&#8217;re playing your portable games on a TV through your SNES! It&#8217;s not a particularly good recommandation in this day and age because you&#8217;re outputting through the low-resolution of a Super Nintendo, and you&#8217;re missing out on the physical experience; the Game Boy is meant to be played between your palms, not on a distant TV screen. It also suffers from a timing quirk that makes games around 2.4% faster. For gameplay purposes you probably won&#8217;t realize the speed difference, but you will certainly hear it. A 2.4% difference in the speed of music is definetely noticeable.</p>

<p>A Super Game Boy is the only way to experience specific improvements provided by games that support it however. You can enjoy a game-supplied border, and games could designate their own palette to use when played on Super Game Boy. On no other device will you be able to see those borders: not even the Game Boy Player implements those. On the other hand, very few games have interesting Super Game Boy support: the best title is surprisingly the first one released, <em>Donkey Kong</em>. It was made by Nintendo to highlight <a href="https://loveconquersallgam.es/post/2379636248/fuck-the-super-game-boy-donkey-kong">everything that was possible on Super Game boy</a>. You are not missing much by not playing your favourite games on Super Game Boy.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-pocket-the-fathers-swan-song">Game Boy Pocket, the Father&#8217;s Swan Song</h3>

<p>Next up is the Game Boy Pocket, the first complete redesign of the Game Boy platform. It&#8217;s a great little device, and Yokoi Gunpei&#8217;s last project at Nintendo. The buttons are nice and have good actuation, but they are not as chunky as a DMG-01. They&#8217;re smaller and feel shallower. Nothing overtly negative, but they feel different. The screen is still a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-twisted_nematic_display">super-twisted nematic LCD</a>, but it&#8217;s much better than on the original DMG-01. It&#8217;s black on grey, for one, and has much less ghosting than the original console. The screen is still unlit, so you have the same exact need to find a suitable light source. The Game Boy Pocket also uses AAA batteries; I don&#8217;t know about you, but those are always a pain to keep in stock at home. I always have AAs, never AAAs. Finally, it introduced a new link port format, meaning you need an adapter if you want to do two-player duels with an original Game Boy or use its cables. On the positive side, the new link port introduced with the Game Boy Pocket persisted all the way to the Game Boy Advance SP. It means only the original Game Boy requires an adapter to interface with newer Game Boy consoles.</p>

<p>The Game Boy Pocket is not as common to find as an original grey brick, since it sold far less units than the original device, and so is usually more expensive to purchase. I feel you buy a Game Boy Pocket to complete a collection; it&#8217;s not the first thing you should buy due to its price and the fact it only reduces the issues of the original device rather than fix them.</p>

<h3 id="super-game-boy-2-the-magic-cartridge-made-better">Super Game Boy 2, the Magic Cartridge Made Better</h3>

<p>The succesor to the Super Game Boy, the Super Game Boy 2 is a new revision of the Super Nintendo cartridge that now features a second generation link port. This means you can trade Pokémons or play games with a Game Boy, or god forbid another Super Game Boy 2! The introduction of the link port meant the timing port was also fixed, since you can&#8217;t link to another console if they are running at different clock speeds. The Super Game Boy 2 came out fairly late and was only released in Japan. It means you usually have to import one, and you have to break internal plastic tabs in your Super Nintendo to fit this Japanese cartridge, which you might not want to do. It also leaves European players out in the cold since it can only work on an NTSC console. You&#8217;re finally still not getting the best experience; nothing beats the physical experience of holding a Game Boy in your hands.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-light-the-forbidden-fruit">Game Boy Light, the Forbidden Fruit</h3>

<p>Now comes the final form of the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Light. It&#8217;s basically a Game Boy Pocket with the addition of a green backlit LED. I have personally never tried one because it is expensive and rare. It was only released in Japan six months before the release of the Game Boy Color, and did not sell well at all. This makes it the rarest Game Boy model by far, which has given it somewhat of a legendary reputation as the best Game Boy of all time. It appears, from reading and watching reviews of the device, that this legendary reputation is unwarranted. The screen seems to be the exact same screen as the Game Boy Pocket, which means it has the same ghosting. It obviously has a backlight, but to the modern eye this is not a neutral light source. It is disturbingly green. To power this light, the device upgrades its two batteries to AAs, a much better battery situation. A Game Boy Advance SP AGS-101 features a much better screen backlight for a fraction of the price. For this reason, I think the Game Boy Light is better reserved for the mindful collector instead of someone wishing to play with the device.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-color-the-exciting-successor">Game Boy Color, the Exciting Successor</h3>

<p>In 1998, Nintendo finally released a successor to their most successful product, which was lovingly called the Game Boy Color. You might come to the conclusion that we are looking at a brand new console, but the Game Boy Color is really a stopgap measure designed to keep Nintendo slightly ahead of the competition. After their initial attempts at a new device, codenamed <a href="https://nintendo-online.de/upload/images/2016/03/09/110326906656e03cc6097c88-22465637.jpg">Project Atlantis</a> fell through, the engineers at R&amp;D1 quickly came up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEJVOH6Pxkg">a design improving on the original Game Boy platform</a>. The new system plays games in colour, duh, and features more RAM and a faster CPU. It is also completely backwards compatible, providing a choice of colour palette upon starting the console with a grey cartridge. The most important takeaway as a modern Game Boy player is the introduction of a new screen technology: it uses a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gbc/916513-game-boy-color/faqs/6115">TFT-LCD display</a> instead of the earlier STN displays, which improves the quality of the screen, finally ridding us of any sort of ghosting. TFT displays are a very ubiquitous technology; you won&#8217;t look at a Game Boy Color screen and feel like it is strange. The major caveat of the Color&#8217;s display is that it is still unlit. A final small quirk of the display is its smaller physical size. It is X by X instead of X by X. The pixels are a bit smaller, since the resolution has stayed exactly the same.</p>

<p>It is also the only system that will display the colours of clear cartridges accurately. Future displays will have small differences in their colour palettes. Nothing that should turn you away from a Game Boy Advance, but a benefit to playing on a Game Boy Color nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-advance-the-hobbled-next-generation">Game Boy Advance, the hobbled next generation</h3>

<p>What comes next is the Game Boy Advance. The real successor to the Game Boy, it is a gangbuster ARM device with great specs, but also a device with a real commitment to backwards compatibility. For this reason, the device supports all previous Game Boy titles, acting exactly like a Game Boy Color when used. Nintendo really worked hard to support older titles adequately; the GBA screen only increased the resolution horizontally, meaning no pixel scaling is required to use the full height of the screen. Game Boy multiplayer still works, but keep in mind that the cables themselves are generationnally incompatible. If you want to play a Game Boy title with another player you need to use a Game Boy link cable (even between two GBA devices) and if you want to play a GBA title, you must use a GBA cable.</p>

<p>In terms of modern usage, it is perhaps the worst way to play a Game Boy title. It features a screen that washes out the colours of GBC titles, yet is still unlit and is harder to see than a Game Boy Color. Nintendo were really pushing the limits of an unlit screen, and I feel that with the GBA, they went too far. It&#8217;s simply too hard to see. For that reason, you are much better served with any other device when playing Game Boy games. It still uses two AA batteries, and drains them quite quickly when playing a GBA title. Market-wise, since the device is unlit and generally unappreciated, it can be had for a lower price. That&#8217;s a benefit that might interest you. I&#8217;ll finish with the one advantage the device has. Its arranged in a landscape orientation, which is extremely confortable to hold, and is the way all new portable consoles are arranged. Sony&#8217;s portable consoles, the DS &amp; 3DS lines, the Switch and the Steam Deck all feature a landscape button orientation for a very good reason. It&#8217;s just a better layout.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-advance-sp-the-grand-timeless-design">Game Boy Advance SP, the grand timeless design</h3>

<p>Out of the successful but hobbled Game Boy Advance design, came the second attempt that corrected all the mistakes: the wonderful Game Boy Advance SP. If you can buy only one Game Boy, make it a Game Boy Advance SP. It has everything you want in a device. It&#8217;s hinged, meaning you can close it and protect the screen when it&#8217;s in a pocket. It features an internal rechargeable battery, meaning you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping batteries on tap. Of course, those internal batteries are getting old and can stop holding a charge, but third-party replacements are available. You can still play the device plugged in even if the battery is dead.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a perfect device. It&#8217;s buttons are recessed lower inside the plastic. It does not have a headphone jack.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-player-the-thinkering-nightmare">Game Boy Player, the Thinkering Nightmare</h3>

<p>Now we come to the Game Boy Player, an add-on for the Gamecube that allows you to play Game Boy titles on a TV. It is more versatile than a Super Game Boy 2 since it will play Color and Advance cartridges. By the way, you <strong>need</strong> its disc to use the device, the Player will not play games if you don&#8217;t have one in your Gamecube when using it. Too often the Game Boy Player is sold without the disc, making it a useless paperweight. This makes the original disc more valuable than the Game Boy Player device! However, using this original disc, you will see poor display output. It does not produce good image quality. So to get a reasonable image quality out of the device, fans of the Game Boy Player use a fan-made disc from forums somewhere. You need to figure out how to burn that disc, now that DVD burners are out of style, and you need to find the smaller DVDs that fit in the Gamecube. You should also get a first-generation Gamecube made with a component output and get an extremely expensive Gamecube component cable. Are you a caveman, plugging a console with composite ? And did I talk about the cable that allows you to plug a GBA and use that as a controller instead of the funky layout of the Gamecube controller. You <strong>must</strong> get one of those. I think you get my point: it gets complicated <strong>real quick</strong> to play a portable system who&#8217;s main appeal is simplicity. Skip the Game Boy Player, you&#8217;ll never stop managing your setup if you go down that route.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-advance-sp-ags-101-the-grand-timeless-design-made-perfect">Game Boy Advance SP AGS-101, the grand timeless design made perfect</h3>

<p>Its got a lot of good qualities but its light is frontlit, so my recommendation is the Game Boy Advance SP with backlit display, the AGS-101. What do you mean backlit? I mean the screen you&#8217;re looking at right now. A smartphone, a laptop screen, an LCD TV, they&#8217;re all backlit. This is the type of screen we&#8217;re all used to and the AGS-101 is the only portable system able to play Game Boy cartridges that has a truly great screen. The colours of Game Boy Color games are not exact, being slightly brighter than they are on the original color system but it is <strong>backlit</strong> and has an internal battery. The cartridges jut out from the bottom of the console but it&#8217;s not a deal-breaker. It lacks an headphone jack, but you can find cheap adapters on eBay that plug into the charging port and give you a standard headphone jack.</p>

<h3 id="game-boy-micro-the-non-choice">Game Boy Micro, the non-choice</h3>

<h3 id="emulation-the-end-of-us-all">Emulation, the end of us all</h3>

<p>Finally, emulation. The 3DS allows you to buy a very limited list of Game Boy games and play them on the 3DS. It&#8217;s a great way to buy games that might be difficult to find otherwise. However, the 3DS Virtual Console does not allow you to play the black cartridges as if they were running on the original Game Boy. Otherwise, go for it, although I haven&#8217;t tried it. Emulated titles on 3DS are kind of expensive.</p>

<h3 id="third-party-devices-inluding-the-analogue-pocket">Third-Party Devices, inluding the Analogue Pocket</h3>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend doing the modifications yourself. Modified devices always command a large premium that is oftentimes hard to justify. Considering those modifications might not survive a long time due to their strange nature, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend spending a fortune on a so-called <em>perfect</em> Game Boy.</p>

<p>Things to keep in mind with modifications are as follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screen backlights
Screen backlights are probably the most popular third-party modification. While the light problem of a device can be improved with a backlight, the much harsher problem of ghosting cannot be solved. On top of that, the screens which can be backlit are getting very old for the cheap technology they use. No empirical research has been done, but it seems that original Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket screens are getting dimmer and producing more ghosting as time goes on. Knowing the internal technology ofthese screens, it makes sense to me. For that reason, I recommend agaisnt putting any money and effort in putting a backlight on a cheap 30 years old screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modifications are unnecessary to enjoy Game Boy games, and anyone who says you <strong>need</strong> a modded device to have fun is wrong. Of course, repairing a broken device with new parts is a fair endeavour, which I&#8217;ll discuss briefly. Let&#8217;s now look at each device in chronological order.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll invariably read about modifications that <em>solve</em> the problems of the original screen. Do not fall into that trap. People will do all sort of weird modifications to the DMG-01 to get better contrast and a backlight, but no modification can remove the ghosting, which is the biggest issue of the screen. You&#8217;re better off enjoying the screen as it is, or getting a more recent Game Boy.</p>

<h2 id="why-include-the-game-boy-color-on-game-boy-essentials">Why Include the Game Boy Color on Game Boy Essentials?</h2>

<p>If we only look at the hardware, the Game Boy and Game Boy Color are indeed distinct systems. The Game Boy Color features an 8 MHZ processor (twice as fast as the Game Boy), more RAM and obviously a colour screen. However, everything else is exactly the same. The processor is the same family (a custom Zilog 80 derivative), the screen has the same resolution, the system features the same button layouts and the Color is perfectly backward compatible with <strong>all</strong> Game Boy titles. The Game Boy Color is Nintendo&#8217;s first backward compatible system, and I would argue its marketing made the idea of backwards compatibility mainstream to begin with. Previous backward compatible consoles include Sega&#8217;s SG-1000 family and the Atari 7800. However, the first blockbuster system to bank on backwards compatibility and be recognized for its ability to play a previous system is the Game Boy Color. The similarities between Game Boy and Game Boy Color are not enough to allow us to call them the same system; we still end up with the conclusion that they are two distinct consoles. But if we look at the games, their release dates and Nintendo&#8217;s own explanation of what the system was we get a different answer.</p>

<p>First, <strong>Nintendo did not release any Game Boy Color launch titles</strong>. You read that right. The system launched with black cartridges only, games that are ultimately original Game Boy titles. <em>Centipede</em>, <em>Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2</em>, <em>Pocket Bomberman</em> and <em>Tetris DX</em> released in the US; all Game Boy games with special Game Boy Color palettes. They are not strictly Game Boy Color games. Since they can run on an original system they cannot take advantage of the Game Boy Color&#8217;s extra RAM or processor speed. They feature colour, of course, but <em>without being able to use all the colours at the same time</em>. They&#8217;re Game Boy games with limited colour palettes.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re getting there but not quite. Second, we have to look at the release calendar to truly tip the scales. You see, after the release of the Game Boy, third-party developers kept developing Game Boy games with Color palettes. Keep in mind, those games also featured <em>different</em> Super Game Boy palettes. So for those black cartridges, the Game Boy Color was basically a second color palette distinct from the Super Game Boy (there are some very strange exceptions). You have to wait six months until Nintendo released <em>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em> to see a true Game Boy Color game from Nintendo. A port of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> from the NES, it truly looks impossible to do on the Game Boy. Most developers, though, started shipping games only for Game Boy Color­ a year after the initial release of the system. Everybody was basically following Nintendo&#8217;s lead. On top of that, big releases like <em>Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver</em> were still Game Boy titles. There are black cartridges hitting the market up to three months <strong>after</strong> the release of the Game Boy Advance in 2001.</p>

<p>So you basically have a library of games that slowly transitions from Game Boy cartridges to Super Game Boy enhanced cartridges to Game Boy Color enhanced games to finally exclusive Game Boy Color games, but only in late 2001. This slow transition is on purpose, intended to slowly ease people into the idea of a new system progressively. At the same time, you keep taking advantage of the record-breaking installed base of the Game Boy for large scale blockbusters. I mean, the one game that truly sold people on the idea of the Game Boy Color, <em>Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver</em>, was not a game only for Game Boy Color!</p>

<p>To me, what we have here is a distinct hardware platform that Nintendo <strong>did not</strong> want to completely differentiate. Nintendo wanted to present the Game Boy Color as a new way to play Game Boy games, first and foremost. <em>The Game Boy is now in colour. Some of those games have better colours and they&#8217;re black cartridges, and some of those game have colours that are so good they&#8217;re only playable on a Game Boy Color.</em> By slowly releasing games only for Game Boy Color as time went on, Nintendo eased people into accepting that some games were unplayable on the original Game Boy. While still in the eye of the average consumer looking like it was one system. That marketing message resonates with me and leads me to consider both console systems one continuous family.</p>

<p>The same two reasons explain the Game Boy Advance&#8217;s differences and the Game Boy Color&#8217;s similarities: the hardware and the release titles.</p>

<p>The Game Boy Advance is a totally different beast from the Game Boy Color. It&#8217;s a 32-bit ARM machine with a wider display and two extra shoulder buttons. The layout of the system is horizontal, in an obvious ploy to differentiate the system from its forebear. Everything about it screams <strong>I&#8217;m not a Game Boy, I&#8217;m much better!</strong></p>

<p>With release titles, the Game Boy Advance had one of the largest release library. Developers immediately flocked to the Game Boy Advance. The few developers that still released games for Game Boy Color did so in small quantities with the public mostly ignoring them. It was a swift transition. By the end of 2002, the Game Boy Color was done.</p>

<p>To me they&#8217;re two different systems and so I can safely ignore the Game Boy Advance on this website. There&#8217;s also the painful reality of time. I&#8217;m having a hard time envisioning the endgame with only Game Boy and Game Boy Color to cover. With my low output, I&#8217;d have to write from the grave to properly cover the Game Boy Advance as well.</p>
