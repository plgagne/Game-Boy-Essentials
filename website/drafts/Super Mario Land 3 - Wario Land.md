In his first video game appearance in *Super Mario Land 2*, Wario has taken over Mario’s private island. This private abode for video game's most successful character has a giant statue of him, a private hippopotamus launchpad to the moon, his very own haunted house, and a gigantic palatial castle all for the glory of the famous plumber. What is interesting about this island is that it was devised by young developpers of R&D1, not by Miyamoto Shigeru. Those young developpers, including Wario's creator Kiyotake Hiroji, were egging on Mario's success. Mario is so sucessful he's got a castle and an enormous statue dedicated to himself. In a sense, they were egging on Miyamoto himself.

In that game, Wario's role is very much that of Bluto; Kiyotake has said so himself. He's an evil analogue of Mario jealous of his success so he stole his private island. But they had trouble making a game that respected the Mario gameplay ethos, so when came time to make a sequel they jumped on a great opportunity *Super Mario Land 2* gave them. Everybody enjoyed Wario's farcical take on Mario so he was promoted to protagonist for the sequel. Changing their protagonist could give them new exciting gameplay opportunities. With Wario, they could escape the straightjacket of a Super Mario game. They were now making a Wario game, so they could make their own choices; they no longer had to respect the Mario gameplay traditions. They could make fun of them now.




Imagine that at work someone comes up with a joke about your work output. Nothing too vile but it's clearly making fun of your work and your success. And people **love** that joke. They keep repeating it over and over again to the point it becomes a substantial revenue generating concern for the company. Part of your employer's money suddenly comes from a joke at your expense. Think about that. Think real hard about the emotional pain of that. How horrible it is. **That's what Wario is to Miyamoto since 1992.**

Chris Kohler À lui que la peur on bonifie allemand vu que les joueurs avaient de la difficulté à appliquer sur le bouton et le bouton à un après l’autre sur la game Boy. Jeremy riche en présumé que c’était parce qu’il est Boy plus lourd que manette de Nintendo. Les développeurs Warriors donc décidé de séparer les contrôles du personnage et de ne pas faire forcer le joueur et sur les deux boutons en même temps

But he only became a yellow God after his appearance in *Mario Land 2*. I feel that by the time *Mario Kart 64* rolled around and Miyamoto himself was forced to work with the character his coworkers invented to make fun of his ideas, my golden boy had fully transcended into his post-modern perfect self. Let me explain.

Wario is one of the most clever joke ever played at the expense of someone else. Wario is saying: Miyamoto, your creation everybody loves, this Mario dude well guess what he's dumb. He smells like farts. Imagine the exact reverse of your dumb character. He's fat, he's ugly, he's vain, he's gross, everybody finds him useless. **And he's a better character than your poor attempt at copying Popeye.** Wario is saying: Miyamoto, your creative output is shit.

Fuck. I love Wario so much.

## Conclusion

Nintendo usually releases one new title per franchise per console. They've been doing it since their earliest days, and they have rarely strayed from this formula. One new *Animal Crossing* game per console, one new *Legend of Zelda* game per console. Before the release of the Super Nintendo, however, the company had made sequels to their most iconic series: Super Mario had multiple Famicom titles. Altough the lineage gets complicated with the second game, *Super Mario Bros. 3* elevated the concepts of the previous titles while still being on the same hardware.

SO the two pseudo sequels here are kind of some sense of a transition perhaps?
