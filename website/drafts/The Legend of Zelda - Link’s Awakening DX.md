I already wrote a long article about *Link's Awakening*. Why the hell am I writing about the game once again?

This is an article more about a moment than a game.

# A Quick History of the DX and Deluxe Naming Scheme
When the NES came out nationwide after its test release, two versions were available. First there was the Control Deck which came with two controllers and *Super Mario Bros.*. Second was the Deluxe Set which included a cornuccopia of accessories. You got R.O.B., *Gyromite*, a grey Zapper gun, *Duck Hunt*, and two controllers. This was Nintendo of America's first use of the word deluxe. Here, it denoted the *most expensive* version of their console. Note that it did not include *Super Mario Bros.*, which quickly made it unattractive to prospective buyers and meant the package was ultimately retired. Few NES sold in North America were a Deluxe Set.

The word stayed dormant with Nintendo until the 1998 release of *Tetris DX*. Here, the word is reduced to two letters and gains a new meaning. It now denotes an enhanced version of a previously released game. Other games soon followed, *The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX* and *R-Type DX*, always implying an improved colour version of a classic Game Boy title. The full unshortened word returns with *Super Mario Bros. Deluxe*, a new version of the original NES *Super Mario Bros.* chock-full of features. Perhaps there was an attempt at a differentiation between DX and Deluxe, with DX reserved for Game Boy games and Deluxe for TV console titles. Or DX was meant to indicate the game was still playable on Game Boy, while Deluxe indicated a game exclusively for Game Boy Color. We can't know for sure, since we have only one example.

Nevertheless, both words stayed unused once again until more than a decade later, with the 2012 release of *Freakyforms Deluxe: Your Creations, Alive!* for 3DS. Using a similar golden sheen for the word Deluxe than the one used with *Super Mario Bros. Deluxe*, the game is not a sequel of the original per se, since it includes everything from the first title. The word was used to denote an improved version of the original *Freakyforms*.

The Wii U had two versions avaiable upon release: the Basic Set and the Deluxe Set, this being the last use of the word Deluxe by Nintendo to indicate the *most expensive* version of a console. The Deluxe Set's console was black and had a larger 32GB internal SSD, came with *Nintendo Land*, a gamepad charging stand, a console stand, and a 10% return on digital purchases for a year. Later sets including different packed-in games featured the Deluxe word, with the unfortunate *Mario Kart 8* Deluxe Set clashing with the later Switch release of the seminal karting title. The Switch would later see the word Deluxe used for the *Monster Hunter Rise* Deluxe set, but I believe the set used this name due to the Deluxe Kit DLC for *Monster Hunter Rise* being included with the system's purchase. This closes the book on Nintendo using Deluxe for consoles.

On the software front, Nintendo solidly revived the word to indicate a rerelease of an earlier title with added features. *Kirby Triple Deluxe* used the word Deluxe to denote an improved version of an original title upon its release in 2014. We have a new era of Deluxe titles starting in 2017 with the release of the Switch, with *Team Kirby Clash Deluxe*, *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *Pokken Tournament DX*. The Pokémon Company seems to be enamored with the DX letters, using it with the aforementioned Pokken and *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX* in 2020. We saw further Deluxe titles with *New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe* and *Layton's Mystery Journey Deluxe Edition* in 2019, *Pikmin 3 Deluxe* in 2020 and *Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe* in 2023. Of note, *Donkey Kong Contry: Tropical Freeze* in 2018 did not feature the Deluxe wording, even though it's a port of a Wii U title with added features, like all the other Switch Deluxe games.

Digging through history, I think this nomenclature was defined all the way back with *Space Invaders Deluxe* in 1979, which released in Japan as *Space Invaders Part II*. Coupled with *Asteroids Deluxe* releasing a couple of years later, those two tiltes cemented the marketing idea of an improved version of a game called a deluxe version. Even though those two games can be seen as sequels, they both add features to the original gameplay and really embody this idea of a deluxe version of a game featuring new twists on an older game. The fact both of those titles were attempts to fight illegal clones of the original title does not escape notice.

## Link's Awakening DX
My cousin was asking me to open up the game for him. Why ? Because it's convoluted.

Straw millionaire quest being mandatory
The powder used for talon
Etc.

Thinking about my last article got me thinking way more about how difficult it truly is.

The game was lent to me and then I played it on a DMG. Then I bought a Color after giving the game back Then I waited more than a decade before buying DX for myself and finally going to the secret colour dungeon. Let me tell you: it is hella underwhelming.

the camera thing was using the printer for an attempt at something good.
the idea you need the tool hidden in the dungeon to complete the dungeon came from this game. Link to the Past does not require its hidden tool for every dungeon, only some.

kirby is in the game, yoshi.

## A Switch remake with a terrible framerate
I talked in my article about the non-DX version that I felt like *Link's Awakening* was **my** Zelda game. I discovered later in life that my feeling was shared by everyone. Everyone felt like this game spoke to them. It has a very particular atmosphere, with its island setting and small map surrounded by water. This makes you feel wistful. You're a prisoner in paradise. The level of detail is asppealing, with characters doing more than the one single thing they were doing on *Link to the Past*. Marin in particular is incredibly vibrant; she sings, reflects on her existence on a beach, visits the neighboring village to help them out. She feels like someone who enjoys her confortable life but dreams of more. These great details means it is not a reduced game for Game Boy, like *Super Mario Land*. It's as involved as the previous games, if not more. It's just a shorter experience.

The dungeons were also very fun. Their structure is now so rote Nintendo had to get rid of them to keep the Zelda games fresh, but *Link's Awakening* is the first time we saw the typical Zelda dungeon structure. You find a new item in a dungeon, and then use that new item to complete the puzzles within, particularly to find the boss key. The boss also requires inventive use of the new tool you found. This structure is so satisfying! It's just so fun to unroll the mysteries and puzzles of the dungeons in the game. There's a reason they milked this dungeon structure so much. Ultimately, popular opinion soured on this rigid structure after the release of *Skyward Sword*. Even though we're all in awe at the formless experimentation of *Breath of the Wild* and *Tears of The Kingdom*, this classic dungeon setup is an incredible thing. Since *Link's Awakening* was the first time Zelda dungeons used this rigid structure, it made the game incredibly impressive. You had a Zelda game that improved on the franchise's mechanics on the lowly Game Boy!

*Link's Awakening*, obtuse puzzles with inscrutable solutions notwithstanding, thus has a great reputation.
