I promised myself I wouldn't do unreleased games nor unlicensed titles. But for this one game, I must make an exception.

*Tyrannosaurus Tex* is my white whale. Like Moby Dick hunting his nemesis to the ends of the earth, I was sailing on the internet seas forever waiting for the perfect catch. From the moment I first heard of *Tyrannosaurus Tex*, I had to own this game. Because it's a first-person shooter!

As we have previously discussed time and time again, by 2001, there was this small but vibrant community of developpers who could make the Game Boy Color do crazy things.

- *Heroes of Might & Magic* tried to bring the storied PC game to Game Boy Color.
- *Warlocked* legitimately simplified the rules and controls of an RTS for portable play.
- *Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare* used high resolution images for its backgrounds to try and replicate the atmsophere of the action horror series.
- *Resident Evil*, another unreleased white whale, was an attempt to port the phenomenally succesful horror classic to Game Boy Color of all things. We instead got the far less impressive *Resident Evil Gaiden* that still managed to feature advanced technical chops.
- *Disney â‹… Pixar Toy Story Racer* attempted to fool players into thinking they were playing a 3D kart racer. *Cannon Fodder* legitimately ported the British game with its animated cutscenes *somewhat* present.
- *Dragon's Lair* is a reasonable attempt to bring the animated game to Game Boy Color. Ultimately it's very impressive if flawed.

Those games, even the unreleased ones, are magical

The company making it has an insane history.
