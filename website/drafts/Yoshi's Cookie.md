## Short explanation and light review

*Yoshi's Cookie* is fine. It's not better than what is on Lynx or Game Gear. It's not going to enlighten your life or break anybody's brain with its inventive concept. You'll pull it out, play it because it is not another falling block puzzle game. Its blocks fall from both the top and right side you see. It's fine.

## Moving on to the more varied and impressive SNES version

## The GB version is made by TOSE, quick turnaround after BPS associated with Nintendo and got the Yoshi license.

Why does *Yoshi's Cookie* exist? On the heels of *Tetris* being the flagship title for Game Boy, many developers were selling puzzle games on Game Boy. Players were invariably looking for something like *Tetris* but different enough to give them a new experience. It was assuredly a profitable venture for those companies, but [the games were always a minority of releases on the console](https://www.chrismcovell.com/GameBoyDecline.html). It was nonetheless a differentiating advantage of Game Boy in the early 90s; the [Sega Game Gear](https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:puzzle/platform:game-gear/sort:date/page:1/) and [Atari Lynx](https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:puzzle/platform:lynx/sort:date/page:1/) only offered their players a mere handful of puzzle titles and they never had *Tetris* due to the portable console exclusivity agreement Henk Rogers managed to sign for Nintendo.

So we end up back with Henk and his company Bullet-Proof Software. Ever the dealmaker, Henk Rogers finds a puzzle game developed by Home Data, a small japanese company. The creator of the original game has [talked about the development history on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gdri/timelines/609352873663705089), and a translation by GDRI is available on the [talk page for Biox of all places](https://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Talk:Biox). They created the concept of the game as a way to use old arcade boards. The game had zero connection with Nintendo or Yoshi at that point. It was merely the work of a small japanese company. The game used an alchemy conceit and a slightly different ruleset. They finished development and moved on to a test release in two arcade locations that were very unsatisfactory. They then started shopping the game around to other companies in the hope they would buy it from them. Henk Rogers was sent a prototype board and saw enough potential to license the concept.

He afterwards started working on his own version seemingly called *Inaro*. We're not sure on the how and when but Henk Rogers managed to convince Nintendo to join the project. They provided their greatest asset; the game was rebranded with their hottest new character, Yoshi. TOSE was commissioned with the production of the NES and Game Boy version of what was now called *Yoshi's Cookie* and Bullet-Proof Software made and released the SNES version eight months later. [Mariowiki covers the development history very well](https://www.mariowiki.com/Yoshi's_Cookie#Development) and has links to fascinating footage of Inaro.

## Alexei Pajitnov's role on *Yoshi's Cookie*

Pajitnov is credited on the box of the SNES version with the puzzle design. I think he was a sub-contractor, and honestly I'm a bit shocked he wasn't on the marketing for the game. Keep in mind, dear reader, that he made puzzles for the SNES and SNES version only. He is [not credited on Game Boy, and his puzzles are nowhere to be seen](https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/yoshis-cookie/credits). The SNES game was developed by BPS, and I'm inclined to think Pajitnov worked on the game before the Yoshi branding arrived, and the NES and GB versions were commissionned to TOSE while BPS finished the SNES version.

I get that putting his name on the box might have been confusing after you have decided on focusing the game on Yoshi and Mario. But they totally could have had the puzzles section called *Pajitnov's Challenges* or something. You mention it on the back of the box. In the game you put a little chibi version of Pajitnov just like Will Wright in *Sim City*. You have him say something along the lines of: "I invented *Tetris* you know! Can you solve my cookie puzzles? They're devious, and delicious!"

## Conclusion is its so much better than *Yoshi*, which I despise. Cookie came a year later, it's kind of a sequel.
