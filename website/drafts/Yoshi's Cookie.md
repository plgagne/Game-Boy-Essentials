## Short explanation and light review

*Yoshi's Cookie* is fine. It's not better than what is on Lynx or Game Gear. It's not going to enlighten your life or break anybody's brain with its inventive concept. You'll pull it out, play it because it is not another falling block puzzle game. Its blocks fall from both the top and right side you see. It's fine.

## Moving on to the more varied and impressive SNES version

## The GB version is made by TOSE, quick turnaround after BPS associated with Nintendo and got the Yoshi license.

Why does *Yoshi's Cookie* exist? On the heels of *Tetris* being the flagship title for Game Boy, many developers were selling puzzle games on Game Boy. Players were invariably looking for something like *Tetris* but different enough to give them a new experience. It was assuredly a profitable venture for those companies, but [the games were never more than 30% of yearly releases on the console](https://www.chrismcovell.com/GameBoyDecline.html). It was nonetheless a differentiating advantage of Game Boy in the early 90s; the [Sega Game Gear](https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:puzzle/platform:game-gear/sort:date/page:1/) and [Atari Lynx](https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:puzzle/platform:lynx/sort:date/page:1/) only offered their players a small selection of puzzle titles and they never had *Tetris* due to the portable console exclusivity agreement Henk Rogers managed to sign for Nintendo.

So we end up back with Henk and his company Bullet-Proof Software. Ever the dealmaker, Henk Rogers finds a puzzle game developed by Home Data, a small japanese company. The creator of the original game has [talked about the development history on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gdri/timelines/609352873663705089), and a translation by GDRI is available on the [talk page for Biox of all places](https://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Talk:Biox). They created the concept of the game as a way to use old arcade boards. The game had zero connection with Nintendo or Yoshi at that point. It was merely the work of a small japanese company. The game used an alchemy conceit and a slightly different ruleset. They finished development and moved on to a test release in two arcade locations. This test was very unsatisfactory. The people at the company then started shopping the game around to other companies in the hope they would license it from them. Henk Rogers was sent a prototype board and saw enough potential to license the concept.

He afterwards commissions the employees at his company to work on their own version seemingly called *Inaro*. We're not sure on the how and when but Henk Rogers managed to convince Nintendo to join the project. They provided their greatest asset; the game was rebranded with their hottest new character, Yoshi. TOSE was then commissioned with the production of the NES and Game Boy version of what was now called *Yoshi's Cookie* and Bullet-Proof Software made and released the SNES version eight months later. [Super Mario Wiki covers the development history very well](https://www.mariowiki.com/Yoshi's_Cookie#Development) and has links to fascinating details regarding *Inaro*.

The mystery of *Yoshi's Cookie* strange release still lingers in my mind. You have two version made by TOSE, the GB and NES versions. Those versions are for all intent and purposes the same (I NEED TO CHECK THAT) and you have a very different SNES version that came out eight months later made by BPS. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say BPS was working on their *Inaro* version for Super Nintendo before showing the project to Nintendo. When Nintendo came along and joined the project, they let BPS take charge of the Super Nintendo / Super Famicom version and they took care of the Game Boy and NES/Famicom games. They then used TOSE as a sub-contractor as they often did back then for lesser projects like a brand new puzzle game they didn't fully own. This meant Nintendo could quickly pump out their versions while BPS took more time, being a much smaller company.

IN terms of what's different between the TOSE games and the BPS made one, we have to talk about my the good Russian, Alexei Pajitnov.

## Alexei Pajitnov's role on *Yoshi's Cookie*

Pajitnov is credited on the box of the SNES version as the puzzle designer. I think he was a sub-contractor, and honestly I'm a bit shocked he wasn't on the marketing for the game. Keep in mind, dear reader, that he made puzzles for the SNES and SNES version only. He is [not credited on Game Boy, and his puzzles are nowhere to be seen](https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/yoshis-cookie/credits). The SNES game was developed by BPS, and I'm inclined to think Pajitnov worked on the game before the Yoshi branding arrived, and the NES and GB versions were commissionned to TOSE while BPS finished the SNES version.

I get that putting his name on the box might have been confusing after you have decided on focusing the game on Yoshi and Mario. But they totally could have had the puzzles section called *Pajitnov's Challenges* or something. You mention it on the back of the box. In the game you put a little chibi version of Pajitnov just like Will Wright in *Sim City*. You have him say something along the lines of: "I invented *Tetris* you know! Can you solve my cookie puzzles? They're devious, and delicious!"

That would have been cool.

## Conclusion is its so much better than *Yoshi*, which I despise. Cookie came a year later, it's kind of a sequel.

In my extraordinarily long diatribe on the first *Pokémon* games, I talked about my hatred for puzzle title *Yoshi*. Not *Yoshi's Cookie*, just *Yoshi*.
