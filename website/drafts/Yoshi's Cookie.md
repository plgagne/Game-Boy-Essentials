On the heels of *Tetris*, many people were selling puzzle games on Game Boy. It was assuredly a profitable venture, but the trend died down as I think the only people who were still buying Game Boy games were kids uninterested in puzzles.

*Yoshi's Cookie* is fine. It's not going to enlighten your life or break anybody's brain with its inventive concept. You'll pull it out, play it because it is not another falling block puzzle game. Its blocks fall from both the top and right side you see. It's fine.

- Short explanation and light review
- Moving on to the more varied and impressive SNES version
- Pajitnov' role
- The GB version is made by TOSE, quick turnaround after BPS associated with Nintendo and got the Yoshi license.
- Conclusion is its so much better than *Yoshi*, which I despise. Cookie came a year later, it's kind of a sequel.

## Alexei Pajitnov's role on *Yoshi's Cookie*

- Pajitnov is credited on the box of the SNES version with the puzzle design. I think he was a sub-contractor, and honestly I'm a bit shocked he wasn't on the marketing for the game.
- Keep in mind, dear reader, that he made puzzles for the SNES and SNES version only. He is not credited on Game Boy, and his puzzles are nowhere to be seen. Source: https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/yoshis-cookie/credits
- The SNES game was developed by BPS, and I'm inclined to think Pajitnov worked on the game before the Yoshi branding arrived, and the NES and GB versions were commissionned to TOSE.
- I get that putting his name on the box might have been confusing.
- People might think he made the whole game.
- Video game development was far less understood by the playing public back then.
- But they totally could have had the puzzles section called *Pajitnov's Challenges* or something.
- You put a little chibi version of Pajitnov in the game. Just like the Will Wright in *Sim City* and you have him say something along the lines of: "I invented *Tetris* you know! Can you solve my cookie puzzles? They're devious, and delicious!"
