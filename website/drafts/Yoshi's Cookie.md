*Yoshi's Cookie* is fine. It's just as good as other contemporary puzzle games. It's not going to enlighten your life or break anybody's brain with its inventive concept. You'll pull it out, play it because it is not another falling block puzzle game. Its blocks fall from both the top and right side you see. It's fine. These days, a puzzle game with this small amount of features would be derided. Back in 1992 it was good enough to warrant your attention. That's why it's essential.

## Short explanation and light review

*Yoshi's Cookie* is fine. It's just as good as other contemporary puzzle games. It's not going to enlighten your life or break anybody's brain with its inventive concept. You'll pull it out, play it because it is not another falling block puzzle game. Its blocks fall from both the top and right side you see. It's fine.

these days, a puzzle game with this few amount of features would be derided. Back in 1992 it was good enough to warrant your attention.

## Moving on to the more varied and impressive SNES version

## The GB version is made by TOSE, quick turnaround after BPS associated with Nintendo and got the Yoshi license.

Why does *Yoshi's Cookie* exist? On the heels of *Tetris* being the flagship title for Game Boy, many developers were selling puzzle games on Game Boy. Players were invariably looking for something like *Tetris* but different enough to give them a new experience. It was assuredly a profitable venture for those companies, but [the games were never more than 30% of yearly releases on the console](https://www.chrismcovell.com/GameBoyDecline.html). It was nonetheless a differentiating advantage of Game Boy in the early 90s; the [Sega Game Gear](https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:puzzle/platform:game-gear/sort:date/page:1/) and [Atari Lynx](https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:puzzle/platform:lynx/sort:date/page:1/) only offered their players a small selection of puzzle titles and they never had *Tetris* due to the portable console exclusivity agreement Henk Rogers managed to sign for Nintendo. Henk Rogers once again pops up, since he is responsible for the release of *Yoshi's Cookie*.

We end up back with Henk and his company Bullet-Proof Software. Ever the dealmaker, Henk Rogers finds a puzzle game called *Hermetica* developed by Home Data, a small japanese company. The creator of the original game has [talked about the development history on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gdri/timelines/609352873663705089), and a translation by GDRI is available on the [talk page for Biox of all places](https://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Talk:Biox). They created the concept of the game as a way to use old arcade boards. The game had zero connection with Nintendo or Yoshi at that point. It was merely the work of a small japanese company. The game used an alchemy conceit and a slightly different ruleset. They finished development and moved on to a test release in two arcade locations. This test was very unsatisfactory. The people at the company then started shopping the game around to other companies in the hope they would license it from them. Henk Rogers was sent a prototype board and saw enough potential to license the concept.

He afterwards commissions the employees at his company to work on their own version seemingly called *Inaro*. We're not sure on the how and when but Henk Rogers managed to convince Nintendo to join the project. They provided their greatest asset; the game was rebranded with their hottest new character, Yoshi. TOSE was then commissioned with the production of the NES and Game Boy version of what was now called *Yoshi's Cookie* and Bullet-Proof Software made and released the SNES version eight months later. [Super Mario Wiki covers the development history very well](https://www.mariowiki.com/Yoshi's_Cookie#Development) and has links to fascinating details regarding *Inaro*.

The mystery of *Yoshi's Cookie* strange release still lingers in my mind. You have two version made by TOSE, the GB and NES versions. Those versions are for all intent and purposes the same and you have a very different SNES version that came out eight months later made by BPS. What's even weirder is that the NES and Game Boy versions reference *Hermetica* in their debug menu.

If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say BPS was working on their own version, under the codename *Hermetica*. When Nintendo came along and joined the project, they let BPS take charge of the Super Nintendo / Super Famicom version and they took care of the Game Boy and NES / Famicom games. Nintendo then used TOSE as a sub-contractor as they often did back then for lesser projects. A brand new puzzle game they didn't fully own was a perfect use of TOSE, the shadow company who refuses to be credited for their work. TOSE quickly pumped out their two versions while BPS took more time, being a much smaller company. They also implemented more features. During this expedited development, the codename was probably kept until *Yoshi's Cookie* became the game's conceit. Yoshi was a hot new character and they had already released a puzzle game bearing the name the year before. This could be seen as a kind of sequel. In terms of what's different between the TOSE games and the BPS made one, we have to talk about the good Russian, Alexei Pajitnov.

## Alexei Pajitnov's role on *Yoshi's Cookie*

Pajitnov is credited on the box of the SNES version as the puzzle designer. I think he was a sub-contractor, and honestly I'm a bit shocked he wasn't on the marketing for the game. Keep in mind, dear reader, that he made puzzles for the SNES and SNES version only. He is [not credited on Game Boy, and his puzzles are nowhere to be seen](https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/yoshis-cookie/credits). I'm inclined to think Pajitnov worked on the game before the Yoshi branding was even decided.

I get that putting his name on the box might have been confusing. You have decided on focusing the game on Yoshi and Mario, so Pajitnov only confuses things. But they totally could have had the puzzles section called *Pajitnov's Challenges* or something. You mention it on the back of the box. In the game you put a little chibi version of Pajitnov just like Will Wright in *Sim City*. You have him say something along the lines of: "I invented *Tetris* you know! Can you solve my cookie puzzles? They're devious, and delicious!"

That would have been cool. Ultimately, I'm not Henk Rogers and I don't know what was possible to do with Pajitnov's likeness. Rogers and Pajitnov were, and are, friends and started The Tetris Company just a couple of years later. Maybe Pajitnov wasn't interested in that kind of fame?

## Conclusion is its so much better than *Yoshi*, which I despise. Cookie came a year later, it's kind of a sequel.

In my extraordinarily [long article on the first set of *Pokémon* games](/articles/dmg-apee), I talked about my hatred for puzzle title *Yoshi*. Not *Yoshi's Cookie*, just *Yoshi*. It's a terrible game, with brain dead gameplay that can't hold your attention for more than five minutes. It was developed by the people at Game Freak, the company that ended up releasing *Pokémon* years later. Even though their pedigree as good game developers are solid, Game Freak's *Yoshi* is a real failure. How could a team of such talent make such a poor game? I think it's because inventing a falling block-puzzle concept is incredibly hard. Henk Rogers instinctively knew that. He started working in video games by bringing RPGs to Japan, but he made a career out of working with puzzle games. When he received an arcade board of the original *Inaro*, he saw potential in that design and licensed it. The team at Bullet-Proof Software improved the *Inaro* design, seemingly by allowing cookies to come from the top and bottom, since that team of developers knew how to make a competent puzzle game. It turned out a fine title that's nothing revolutionnary That's why playing *Yoshi's Cookie* is essential.
