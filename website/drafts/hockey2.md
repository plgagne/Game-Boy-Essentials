The history of hockey games on Game Boy is the North American history of the little portable console itself. You have some rinkydink early games, when the console was still burgeoning. It was successful, but developers did not know exactly what to do with the console.

Then games get more complicated, as the same time as they become mere accompanying games to more succesful console releases, with NHL 95 and 96. Those releases dry up, without any 1997 release, as the console is slowly losing any sort of momentum. People are tired of Game Boy. Then, a massive amount of games comes out between 1999 and 2001, due to the massive renewed success of the platform coming from the Pok√©mon craze.

Then we have NHL 95 and NHL 96. The fact that they're on Game Boy is somehwat of a mystery. That's when the NHL series, managed by EA Sports.
