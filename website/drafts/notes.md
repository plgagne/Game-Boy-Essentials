I have to cover it at some point.

# Virtual Boy

I should probably talk of the Virtual Boy on the first Wario game after *Virtual Boy Wario Land*. A better point would be with *Kirby’s Dream Land 2*: it came out two months before the Virtual Boy, maybe meant as a last big release before moving on. Maybe Nintendo never intended to abondon the Game Boy wholesale, but similarly to the Disk System, they intended to switch their resources to the Virtual Boy to forge a path forward. I would have to check the calendar of releases to see if that checks out. The Game Boy was running out of steam for sure though.
The Virtual Boy uses the V810, an obscure chip from NEC. NEC was in many arcade boards in the 80s with the predecessors to the V8100. It was a 32-bit RISC, so might have inspired them to go to ARM?

## Virtual Nightmare

To understand, we have to go back to 1991, when the Game Boy was a solid portable device that already looked dated. Its styling was stuck in the 80s, with its large size and troublesome screen. However, Nintendo were on a mission to replicate Sony's Walkman (hence the similar name: Game-Boy, Walk-Man) by making an ubiquitous device that sold on a **global** scale. Since only a Game Boy could play a Game Boy game, Nintendo didn't even have to contend with competition like Sony did with the Walkman. Think about it; any portable tape player can play *Def Leppard* music, but you need a Game Boy for an hypothetical Game Boy *Def Leppard* game. Sega, Atari, NEC were incapable of building a market of their own to compete; they tried cramming console experiences in a portable form-factor and the technology just wasn't ready, so they failed to make a dent in Nintendo's market dominance. Yokoi believed as much; he never worried about those competitors based solely on their use a of a colour screen. He knew how limited the technology was in the early 90s.

Nintendo had free rein to go at their own pace, without any serious competitor in the market. They could simply make more and more grey Game Boy units for more and more markets around the world until they hit saturation.

And they did! The system was a massive consumer success due to its cheap price (only 90$ in 1991, by Christmas 1992 to system had dropped to 80$, and by 1994 it sold for 60$). But Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo president and human shark, wanted another monster hit like the Game Boy: another market-defining device that its competitors could not replicate. Enter Reflection Technology, a small Massachusetts company with a unique idea. Red LEDs were now practical to use in the 80s when Allen Becker, founder of the company, came up with his idea for a display using a single line of red LEDs. A red LED is nowadays usually used to signal if something is on or off: as I write these lines in my living room, two of them are right in front of me. One on my sound system, one on my Wii U.

They could get one row of red LEDs to make their display, but building a whole display out of them was still prohibitively expensive in the 80s and 90s. Instead, they aimed their single line of red lights at a mirror. The mirror was then vibrated in a very precise diagonal motion 50 times a second. The red LEDs then only had to display a different line every fiftieth of a second in sync with the vibrating mirror and it convincignly appeared as if you had fifty lines of red LEDs. Being a very fast light source, the 50hz refresh rate was no issue for the LEDs and it produced no ghosting. Reflection Technology envisioned the technology as a cheap way to make a very small monochromatic display that could be projected directly at your eye. Their initial idea was to make a pager with a tiny hole in it. If you looked through the tiny hole with one eye, you could see a red rendering of faxes sent to the phone number associated with the pager. I know, it sounds terrible.

Gunpei Yokoi saw this screen technology in 1991, already one foot out the door at Nintendo and delayed his deaprture from the company to work on the tech. His idea? Use two of those screens pointed at each eye to create a red 3D image. Nintendo's R&D1 division then spent four years basically trying to design a system around the foolhardy 3D idea that managed to keep Yokoi working for Nintendo. However, the mirrors were fragile, the idea was unmarketable, the monochromatic display meant you couldn't really use polygons (*Red Alarm* nonetheless tried). My source for all this information is [Benj Edwards' seminal article on the development of the Virtual Boy that he wrote for Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3050016/unraveling-the-enigma-of-nintendos-virtual-boy-20-years-later) if you want to know more.

Nintendo R&D1 fumbled to the finish line, and basically lost four years of work on Yokoi's ultimate folly. Four years where they didn't design any substantive hardware to help the money-making Game Boy, except the Super Game Boy and coloured Game Boy models (usually called the *Play It Loud!* Game Boy models after their marketing campaign). The Virtual Boy was released in Japan in 1995 with muted marketing since no one believed in the problematic device. Nintendo of America went about it completely the other way: they launched a large marketing campaign to try and help the device connect with consumers. Neither approach worked, and the Virtual Boy was abandoned within a year of its release.

The story goes that Yokoi, having bet a lot of time and effort on this failure felt ashamed and tried to redeem himself in the eyes of his boss Yamauchi by overseeing the design of the Game Boy Pocket. He then promptly left Nintendo in 1996 after its release to found his own design company, as he had originally planned to do around 1991.

# Hiroshi Yamauchi, supervilain and proud of it

I feel like I need to talk more about my favourite Nintendo president, Hiroshi Yamauchi. President and chairman of Nintendo Co. Ltd. from **1949** to 2002, the man is a force of nature. Coming into the presidency when Nintendo was still a family business making playing cards and assorted sundry, Yamauchi turned the company into the most influential toymaker in the world. So why do I make jokes at his expense, calling him ruthless and a supervilain? You can't achieve something as monumental as *creating Nintendo as we know it* without being ruthless, and Yamauchi was ruthlessness *defined*. He was proud of having never played a video game: he only played Go. He signed extraordinary deals for his company like nobody's business. He built separate sections inside his company, then pitted all of them against each other, zigzagging around them to push them to best one another. He knew to skate where the puck was going; he turned Nintendo from a toy company to a technology pionneer because he knew video games were the future of toys.

For example, the fact the Game Boy has a Z80 derivative CPU is a total Yamauchi move. Nintendo had built the Famicom with a MOS 6502 derivative from Ricoh, and the Super Nintendo was scheduled to use the next generation of this chip. It would only be natural to get a power-efficient MOS 6502 and put it in the Game Boy. So why does the Game Boy use a completely different architecture that prevents any compatibility? Because they hedged their bets. Ricoh was a small fab, the MOS family was going nowhere, the future was elsewhere and the Super Nintendo still used their chip because they initially wanted backward compatibility with the NES. So Nintendo zigged instead of zagging. They used the best chip for portable devices, ease of porting games be damned.

I'm not saying Yamauchi is singularly responsible of the Z80 choice, but it exemplifies the company he managed; a company unafraid to silo projects to hedge their bets and come out ahead no matter what.

L’histoire de Nintendo volume 4 page 148 mentions the project was a way to get more cartridges in the small combinis (the Japanese dépanneur).

# Game Boy Valiant Comics
https://www.mariowiki.com/Game_Boy_(comic)

When I was a kid, I found it in a library. It was in the larger bande dessinée size, and I think included the first two issues. I might have been ten years old, and it was, as it was for seemingly everybody who read those comics, a very strange experience. I'm not joking, reading those comics is like a lucid dream. I remember finishing the book and wondering what I had just read. It made no sense that it existed. I felt like I was imagining it, even though I held the book in my hands.

The comics are basically a *Super Mario Land* comics, but do not star Mario. Instead, the stories happen in the real world. The main character of the story, a crummy adult man, steals a Game Boy at work and proceeds to get hypnotized by the villain from *Super Mario Land*, Tatanga. The evil character then transfers to the real world with a captured Daisy in tow. We then have a teen with attitude discover that he can summon Mario to real world by using a third door from the end of levels in the game.

A strange part of the comics is that all the video game characters are Smurf-sized when they come to the real world. So they can't really pose a credible threat. They look like a bunch of aggravating insects more than an impressive display of power. I mean, Mario can fit in a pocket in those comics, what's the point? Whenever Mario has to run through a gauntlet of obstacles meant to evoque a level, the human characters, standing tall above all the small obstacles, always walk next to Mario and the whole level, rendring all the trouble Mario goes through useless. Just walk around it! Mario even gets hit with a food tray by the evil human man in the first issue and he is out cold. Just like swatting a fly. There's also the very unfortunate fact that the first issue features a battle in the restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center. Reading it today makes it even weirder. It is such a strange read. The focus of the story is the human characters, with Mario being more of an afterthought. There are even two competing art styles, one for the humans and one for the game characters. Everything in this comics is a weird misstep.

The comics series was started by George Caragonne, who later became famous, and infamous, as the co-founder and editor of Penthouse Comix. Having read some of the Penthouse stuff for ... research, I can say there are shocking similarities. The way the characters talk about their wishes. The fact everybody is motivated by women, except the human vilain. That this human vilain is hypnotized, and acts like a drug addict. He tries to get rid of his Game Boy, but then commits crimes to get other consoles to summon the pint-sized Tatanga and his army. The fact it's just a bunch of nonsensical stuff that happens to get you to the interesting parts. It just so happens that the interesting part in the Penthouse Comix is not an action scene with a 4-inch tall plumber. It's more like 7 inches of plumbing in those filthy comic books.
